The announcement is the latest of many collaborations for Nvidia, whose Drive platform that helps enable autonomous driving is ubiquitous in the industry. The Silicon Valley-based company known for its graphics chips said last month that 320 companies involved in the development of self-driving cars use Nvidia Drive. Automakers and their suppliers have sought alliances to share the high costs of developing self-driving cars, which are expected to start appearing in the marketplace over the next few years as so-called robo-taxis at first. Still, experts expect the transition from human-driven to automated cars could take a decade or more. Nvidia and Continental said in a statement their self-driving vehicle system, which will integrate a range of Continental sensors, will be introduced in 2021, after a period of collaboration between engineering teams from both companies. The companies did not disclose financial terms for the partnership. At CES in Las Vegas last month, Nvidia announced partnerships with Uber Technologies and Volkswagen AG ( ). The company also works with electric vehicle maker Tesla Inc and China\u2019s Baidu. Continental - which also works on self-driving with Baidu - is part of a separate consortium of automakers and suppliers working together to develop full autonomous driving systems. Led by BMW, that alliance also brings together Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV Intel Corp and Intel\u2019s vision systems subsidiary Mobileye, with Continental handling integration of components and software. U.S. auto supplier Aptiv is also part of the alliance.", "tick": "NVDA", "headline": "Chipmaker Nvidia, auto supplier Continental in self-driving tie-up | Reuters", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}

The company, which also reported better-than-expected quarterly results, is reaping the benefits from the launch of its Volta chip architecture last year. Volta processors power a range of technologies such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars. \u201cVirtually every internet and cloud service provider has embraced our Volta GPUs,\u201d Nvidia\u2019s Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in a statement. Graphic chips were initially developed to handle graphics for high end video games and other computers. These chips help share the processing load from the main chip, making it easier and faster to run high end applications. These chips are now being widely use in new technologies, like artificial intelligence, machine learning. Revenue from Nvidia\u2019s widely watched data center business, which counts Microsoft Corp\u2019s ( ) Azure cloud business as its customer, more than doubled to $606 million. That trounced analysts\u2019 average estimate of $541.1 million. Nvidia also sells chips to Amazon.com Inc\u2019s ( ) Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is dueling with Microsoft to handle data and computing for large enterprises Data center should continue to grow pretty nicely into calendar 2018 and beyond, Morningstar analyst Abhinav Davuluri said. The boom in cryptocurrencies is also powering demand for chips from Nvidia and rival AMD ( ) as they provide the high computing ability required for cryptocurrency \u201cmining.\u201d \u201cStrong demand in the cryptocurrency market exceeded our expectations,\u201d Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call. \u201cWhile the overall contribution of cryptocurrency to our business remains difficult to quantify, we believe it was a higher percentage of revenue than the prior quarter.\u201d The company said inventory levels of its gaming GPUs throughout the quarter was lower than historical channel inventory levels due to surging demand from cryptocurrency miners. The price of Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, rose more than 1,300 percent in 2017. Prices have, however, dropped about 40 percent this year. Nvidia\u2019s revenue from gaming, for which it is best known, rose 29 percent to $1.74 billion, accounting for a more than half of its total revenue in the fourth quarter, and also beating analysts\u2019 estimate of $1.59 billion. The company forecast current-quarter revenue of $2.90 billion, plus or minus 2 percent, well above the analysts\u2019 average estimate of $2.47 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income rose to $1.12 billion, or $1.78 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 28 from $655 million, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier. Results include a $133 million gain related to the new U.S. tax law. Total revenue rose 34 percent to $2.91 billion, topping estimate of $2.69 billion. Excluding items, the company said it earned $1.72 per share. Nvidia earned $1.57 per share, excluding the tax benefit, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, beating estimate of $1.17. The company\u2019s shares were trading at $233 in extended trading. They have surged about 83 percent in the past 12 months.", "tick": "NVDA", "headline": "Nvidia's upbeat forecast powered by data center, cryptocurrency demand | Reuters", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}
{"link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nvidia-results-research/frenzied-demand-for-nvidias-graphic-chips-shoot-prices-through-the-roof-idUSKBN1FT2AW", "source": "https://www.reuters.com/", "text": "(Reuters) - Nvidia Corp\u2019s ( ) graphic processors, or GPUs, are so overwhelmingly popular that gamers and cryptocurrency miners are willing to pay up to three times the original list price to get their hands on its cards online. The company\u2019s GeForce 1070 chip set, which retailed at $349 a year ago, was going for up to $900 from electronics wholesalers on Amazon.com Inc ( ) Friday, and the same demand stood behind a stellar set of corporate results on Thursday. The company\u2019s share price rose 6 percent in early trading on Friday after at least 14 Wall Street brokerages raised their price targets on the stock - a measure of the confidence around the stock among sector analysts. Gamers use GPUs to play high-quality video games, but Nvidia\u2019s high-performing cards are also now used by those building machines to solve the complex math puzzles used to validate transactions and earn more of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and bitcoin. The company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call on Thursday that inventory levels for gaming GPUs were at historically low levels due to cryptocurrency miners. \u201cWe do think that cryptocurrency has been a very significant factor in both revenue and pricing, creating a shortage environment that is boosting pricing,\u201d Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said in a note after the results. Analysts also say Nvidia\u2019s competitive advantage is only likely to increase when it moves its Volta chip architecture, launched last year and only currently present in data-center GPUs, into gaming chips later this year. The new GPU gaming chip, code named Turing, is expected to be unveiled next month. Even without it, Nvidia\u2019s revenue from gaming rose 29 percent to $1.74 billion in the fourth quarter, accounting for more than half of its total revenue. The company\u2019s quarterly data center revenue - powered by the Volta-based data center GPU, Tesla V100 - more than doubled to $606 million as companies such as Alibaba ( ), Amazon ( ), Alphabet ( ), IBM ( ) and Microsoft ( ) adopted the new chip in their servers. Data centers outperformed despite high expectations and Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis said they should do so again given that Volta is in the early stages of adoption. One pocket of concern was an 8 percent fall in automotive revenue quarter over quarter. Auto revenue was down as auto infotainment was becoming commoditized and the company is going through a revenue transition phase to ramping its autonomous driving platforms in volume likely in 2019, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore said.", "tick": "NVDA", "headline": "Frenzied demand for Nvidia's graphic chips shoot prices through the roof | Reuters", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}
