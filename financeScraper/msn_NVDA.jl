{"headline": "Cramer Remix: How to play Nvidia in a volatile market", "author": "Elizabeth Gurdus", "tick": "NVDA", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/08/cramer-remix-how-to-play-nvidia-in-a-volatile-market.html", "text": "CNBC's Jim Cramer is confident that he's pinpointed the real cause of the market-wide sell-off that has weighed on stocks for much of the week. The pain dragged the Dow Jones industrial average down more than 1,000 points on Thursday, with the index closing near correction levels, down 1,032.89 points. \"The real culprit behind today's decline is the same miscreant that's weighed us down for the last couple of days: the unspooling of these obscure products that allowed ... idiotic money managers and neophyte investors to bet against what's known as volatility,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. Very few stocks can withstand hedge-fun-led pain like this, Cramer warned. Big dividends don't help because the market is declining all at once, valuation is no defense because stocks can always go lower and stock buybacks only help \"sop up\" the shares being sold, he said. The only stocks that really work are ones that are able to deliver drastic surprises to the upside, like Twitter after its Wednesday earnings report or GrubHub and Nvidia after their Thursday reports. \"Nvidia reported after the close and it was down hard all day today because of this nonsense I'm describing. But this stock managed to rally in the after-market because the quarter was that fantastic,\" Cramer said. \"If we get a huge down opening tomorrow, which is certainly likely because of what I described, and Nvidia, the stock, goes lower, it might be worth buying. But if it's up big, though, you stay away. It will most likely be pulled down. Don't chase a thing in this market. That's a fool's errand.\" Many market-watchers have been wondering what caused this week's rapid-fire sell-off, so Cramer decided to oust the \"real culprits\" behind the nosedive. \"There are four instruments ... that I am watching to figure out when this portion of stock market nightmare is over,\" he said. \"They're all a mouthful, but you know what? I owe you the whole truth and nothing but the truth, even if you actually need a rocket scientist to figure some of this out.\" Cramer began by explaining the idea behind the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, colloquially known as the market's \"fear gauge.\" Volatility, most commonly tracked by the VIX, refers to the amount of uncertainty in the size and direction of changes in the stock market. It is typically measured by the deviation of returns. For much of 2017, the VIX remained at extremely low levels. Its placid nature piqued Wall Street's interest, leading to the rise of leveraged trading vehicles like the XIV, the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short-Term exchange-traded note, as ways to short the low-volatility layout. \"Now, it isn't enough sometimes on Wall Street to just own volatility or bet against volatility,\" Cramer said. \"Brokerages know people crave real juice, particularly hedge fund managers, so they invented stocks that allowed you to get twice the gain of the VIX on a given day, or get twice the loss of the VIX if it goes down on a given day,\" Cramer said. \"These instruments are the proximate cause of the madness you are now seeing,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said, pointing to four specific funds exacerbating the pain. With markets reeling, one theory that has surfaced to explain the sell-off is that it was driven by the bond market. But Cramer isn't convinced. \"That's just one theory,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. \"Let's say it's the earnings that were driving the rally. Then I could argue stocks as an asset class aren't that overvalued, so you can buy the weakness, especially because the whole market has already become a heck of a lot cheaper in the last few days.\" The problem is that the inverse volatility trading products that Cramer has been railing against are clouding the real reason for the sell-off, making it difficult for him and others to discern whether bonds or earnings are to blame. \"Look at like this: we know we're taking enemy fire, but we won't know where it's coming from until the VIX-related smoke clears,\" Cramer said. In a strategy session with callers from Cramerica, the \"Mad Money\" host helped them figure out how to play the market's downturn. To a caller who wanted to buy a leading sector into the decline, Cramer instantly recommended FANG \u2014 with one exception. \"The reason why you're going to buy FANG is because those are classic what we call long-dated assets,\" Cramer said. \"What matters is you have to buy stocks that have a long-term vision with a CEO who has a great vision that are not necessarily susceptible to the economy. And, yes, that's Facebook, that is Amazon, that is Netflix. I am not going to recommend Google here. I would rather see you be in Adobe.\" Finally, Cramer vetted the first major acquisition of 2018: packaging product maker WestRock's $4.9 billion purchase of KapStone. \"In short, this KapStone acquisition is, objectively, a fantastic thing for WestRock,\" the \"Mad Money\" host said. Not only will the integration of KapStone be immediately additive to the new WestRock's earnings, but the company is guiding towards $200 million in cost synergies and performance improvements, Cramer said. Plus, commodity plays like this paper giant tend to benefit during global economic expansions, and despite the slumping stock market, the United States is mid-economic recovery, he said. \"The truth is, the world hasn't stopped just because the stock market's getting slammed. \u2026 Life goes on, and all of this chaos may be causing you to miss out on an opportunity in the packaging space, the sector that's always been the place to be at this stage of the economic expansion,\" Cramer concluded. \"WestRock makes sense on the KapStone deal, as does the long-time friend of the show, International Paper. Just be careful to scale into them slowly \u2026 but you will have the wind at your back the moment this violent volatility spell is over, and I don't want you to have bought nothing into the downturn.\" In Cramer's lightning round, he rattled off his take on some callers' favorite stocks: Silicon Laboratories: \"That's not the place. I think you can go out and buy an Intel on a day like today, or buy Nvidia if it's down tomorrow.\" Switch: \"We've got so many fabulous stocks that are down so much. I'd rather have you think long-term and buy VMware.\" Disclosure: Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Nvidia.", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/"}

Non-GAAP Measures  To supplement NVIDIA\u2019s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income and Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets presented in accordance with GAAP, the company uses non-GAAP measures of certain components of financial performance. These non-GAAP measures include non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP other income (expense), non-GAAP income tax expense, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP net income, or earnings, per diluted share, non-GAAP diluted shares, and free cash flow. In order for NVIDIA\u2019s investors to be better able to compare its current results with those of previous periods, the company has shown a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures. These reconciliations adjust the related GAAP financial measures to exclude stock-based compensation expense, legal settlement costs, acquisition-related costs, contributions, restructuring and other charges, gains from non-affiliated investments, interest expense related to amortization of debt discount, debt-related costs, the associated tax impact of these items, where applicable, and the provisional tax benefit from income tax reform. Weighted average shares used in the non-GAAP diluted net income per share computation includes the anti-dilution impact of the company\u2019s Note Hedge. Free cash flow is calculated as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and intangible assets. NVIDIA believes the presentation of its non-GAAP financial measures enhances the user\u2019s overall understanding of the company\u2019s historical financial performance. The presentation of the company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the company\u2019s financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP, and its non-GAAP measures may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies.

The company, which also reported better-than-expected quarterly results, is reaping the benefits from the launch of its Volta chip architecture last year. Volta processors power a range of technologies such as artificial intelligence and driverless cars. \"Virtually every internet and cloud service provider has embraced our Volta GPUs,\" Nvidia's Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said in a statement. (http://bit.ly/2iJPeNN) Graphic chips were initially developed to handle graphics for high end video games and other computers. These chips help share the processing load from the main chip, making it easier and faster to run high end applications. These chips are now being widely use in new technologies, like artificial intelligence, machine learning. Revenue from Nvidia's widely watched data center business, which counts Microsoft Corp's Azure cloud business as its customer, more than doubled to $606 million. That trounced analysts' average estimate of $541.1 million. Nvidia also sells chips to Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is dueling with Microsoft to handle data and computing for large enterprises Data center should continue to grow pretty nicely into calendar 2018 and beyond, Morningstar analyst Abhinav Davuluri said. The boom in cryptocurrencies is also powering demand for chips from Nvidia and rival AMD as they provide the high computing ability required for cryptocurrency \"mining.\" \"Strong demand in the cryptocurrency market exceeded our expectations,\" Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call. \"While the overall contribution of cryptocurrency to our business remains difficult to quantify, we believe it was a higher percentage of revenue than the prior quarter.\" The company said inventory levels of its gaming GPUs throughout the quarter was lower than historical channel inventory levels due to surging demand from cryptocurrency miners. The price of Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, rose more than 1,300 percent in 2017. Prices have, however, dropped about 40 percent this year. Nvidia's revenue from gaming, for which it is best known, rose 29 percent to $1.74 billion, accounting for a more than half of its total revenue in the fourth quarter, and also beating analysts' estimate of $1.59 billion. The company forecast current-quarter revenue of $2.90 billion, plus or minus 2 percent, well above the analysts' average estimate of $2.47 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income rose to $1.12 billion, or $1.78 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Jan. 28 from $655 million, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier. Results include a $133 million gain related to the new U.S. tax law. Total revenue rose 34 percent to $2.91 billion, topping estimate of $2.69 billion. Excluding items, the company said it earned $1.72 per share. Nvidia earned $1.57 per share, excluding the tax benefit, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, beating estimate of $1.17. The company's shares were trading at $233 in extended trading. They have surged about 83 percent in the past 12 months.

Stocks plunged another 4 percent on Thursday, overturning gains a day earlier and adding to the sense that a broader correction is firmly underway for Wall Street after nine years of almost uninterrupted gains. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index are down more than 10 percent since hitting record highs on Jan. 26, and Thursday was the second time this week that the Dow fell more than 1,000 points. By 6:40 a.m. EDT Dow e-minis were down 32 points, or 0.13 percent, S&amp;P 500 e-minis were up 3 points, or 0.12 percent, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up just 9.5 points, or 0.15 percent. At the heart of the pullback is a rise in U.S. bond yields due to growing expectations that a robustly performing economy will lead to higher inflation and a steady rise in official interest rates over this year. The danger for stock market investors is that means the Federal Reserve - and other major central banks - reining in the vast supplies of cheap funds they have pumped into the global economy since the 2008-09 financial crisis. The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasuries, which tends to be the driver of global borrowing costs, was hovering at 2.846 percent just short of a four-year high of 2.885 percent hit during Monday's selloff. Investors also point to additional pressure from the violent unwinding of trades linked to bets on volatility staying low. The market's main gauge of volatility, the CBOE Volatility Index, opened at a relatively elevated 32.18 on Friday, nearly three times what it was a week ago but lower than a two-and-a-half-year high of 50.30 points hit on Tuesday. The downturn in equities had been long awaited by investors, after a period of strong and fast gains. The S&amp;P correction is the fifth of this bull market, according to Yardeni Research. The last bear market was during the 2008 financial crisis. World stocks were also on track for their worst week since 2011, knocked by a 4 percent decline in Chinese stocks. The U.S. House of Representatives early on Friday approved a bill to fund the federal government through March 23 and to increase overall spending limits over two years, sending the legislation to President Donald Trump. With Wall Street's quarterly results season more than half-way through, 78.3 percent of the S&amp;P 500 companies have topped profit expectations, above the 72 percent beat rate in the past four quarters. Chipmaker Nvidia was up about 11 percent in premarket trading after its upbeat results and forecast. Expedia shares sank 19 percent after the online travel services company missed analysts' quarterly profit estimate due to higher marketing expenses.

The second largest area, data center, came up with $606 million in revenue, above the consensus estimate of $552.1 million. Nvidia shares rallied 6.7 percent Friday. The stock rose despite a troubling overall market environment right now that saw the Dow Jones industrial average drop more the 1,000 points twice this week. \"We reiterate our outperform rating on NVIDIA and are raising our price target \u2026 following yet another exceptionally strong quarter and guidance,\" Raymond James analyst Chris Caso wrote in a note to clients Thursday entitled \"NVIDIA Does It Again - Another Amazing Beat/Raise.\" \"The stock's valuation is of course high, but as long as the company keeps putting up quarters like this, and with future potential catalysts from Auto and inferencing ahead, we believe shares will continue to move higher.\" Caso raised his price target on Nvidia shares to $275 from $250, representing 26 percent upside to Thursday's close. Nvidia shares are significantly outperforming the market. The stock is up 87 percent in the past 12 months through Thursday compared with the S&amp;P 500's 12 percent gain. That performance ranks No. 3 in the entire S&amp;P 500. One Wall Street firm is stunned over Nvidia's strong guidance for the next quarter. RBC Capital Markets reiterated its outperform rating on the company's shares, citing optimism over its data center business. \"Overall, all of the necessary items were 'meet or exceed' with the most impressive part being the guidance suggesting another material quarter of Data Center growth,\" analyst Mitch Steves wrote in a note to clients Thursday. The company had \"a blow out quarter and guidance well ahead of expectations [and] marches EPS towards $2.00+ EPS run-rate a quarter earlier.\" Steves increased his price target to $280 from $250 for Nvidia shares. KeyBanc Capital Markets pointed to the strength in the cryptocurrency mining market as a big driver of Nvidia's performance. Digital currency miners use graphics cards from AMD and Nvidia to \"mine\" new coins, which can then be sold or held for future appreciation. \"Strong GPU [graphics processing unit] demand from the cryptocurrency mining market has rapidly depleted excess channel inventory and buoyed strong sales, which offsets our prior concerns on gaming segment growth,\" analyst Michael McConnell wrote in a note to clients Thursday.\u2014 CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this story.", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/"}

Gamers use GPUs to play high-quality video games, but Nvidia's high-performing cards are also now used by those building machines to solve the complex math puzzles used to validate transactions and earn more of cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and bitcoin. The company's Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call on Thursday that inventory levels for gaming GPUs were at historically low levels due to cryptocurrency miners. \"We do think that cryptocurrency has been a very significant factor in both revenue and pricing, creating a shortage environment that is boosting pricing,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore said in a note after the results. Analysts also say Nvidia's competitive advantage is only likely to increase when it moves its Volta chip architecture, launched last year and only currently present in data-center GPUs, into gaming chips later this year. The new GPU gaming chip, code named Turing, is expected to be unveiled next month. Even without it, Nvidia's revenue from gaming rose 29 percent to $1.74 billion in the fourth quarter, accounting for more than half of its total revenue. The company's quarterly data center revenue - powered by the Volta-based data center GPU, Tesla V100 - more than doubled to $606 million as companies such as Alibaba, Amazon , Alphabet, IBM and Microsoft adopted the new chip in their servers. Data centers outperformed despite high expectations and Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis said they should do so again given that Volta is in the early stages of adoption. One pocket of concern was an 8 percent fall in automotive revenue quarter over quarter. Auto revenue was down as auto infotainment was becoming commoditized and the company is going through a revenue transition phase to ramping its autonomous driving platforms in volume likely in 2019, Deutsche Bank analyst Ross Seymore said.

The company announced in a blog post on Monday that tensor processing units are available in \"limited quantities\" for a select set of customers looking to run machine learning models on the Google Cloud Platform.  Google unveiled its stealthy TPU project in 2016 and followed up with the second generation of chips at its annual developers' conference last May. The update allowed Google to get into the more sophisticated training phase of deep learning.   Usage is billed by the second and costs $6.50 per Cloud TPU per hour. The TPUs are designed specifically for AI and machine learning workloads and provide two main benefits to Google. First, by using its own silicon, Google has a cheaper, more efficient alternative to relying on chipmakers like Nvidia and Intel for its core computing infrastructure. Owning its own hardware enables Google to experiment faster.    The new TPUs also allow parent company Alphabet to add a revenue stream to the Google Cloud Platform. GCP and Google's collection of business apps called GSuite now generate more than $1 billion a quarter. Google is currently allowing companies to rent individual TPU boards but later this year will let them connect multiple boards into supercomputer networks called TPU pods.", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/"}
