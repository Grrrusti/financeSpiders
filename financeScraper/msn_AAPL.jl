Laffer, and Stephen Moore", "tick": "AAPL", "link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/16/kudlow-trump-needs-a-return-to-king-dollar.html", "text": " The Trump Administration and the Republicans in Congress have passed one of the best pro-growth tax bills ever. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ranks in the all-time hall of fame of legislation, along with Ronald Reagan's 1981 and 1986 Tax Acts and John F. Kennedy's posthumous tax cuts of 1964. The announcements by Apple, FedEx, ATT, Fiat Chrysler and over 300 companies with multi-billion dollar investments in the U.S. are early indicators of good things to come from the tax rate cuts. When this is combined with President Donald Trump's deregulation agenda, we see no reason why the economy cannot grow for a sustained period at 3 to 4 percent growth \u2014 up from 1.6 percent in Obama's last year. But there is still a missing pillar of prosperity in the Trump economic agenda, and that is a sound dollar strategy. The dollar weakened in 2017 and we want it stabilized. There's little in this world that can bring our economy to its knees faster than a weak dollar in the foreign exchange markets. Just ask people who served in the administrations of Nixon, Ford, Carter, Bush 2 and Barack Obama's first term. All of them were undone by a weak and depreciating dollar, surging inflation, spiking interest rates, plus financial or commodity bubbles. Meanwhile, under Reagan the U.S. dollar increased by 67 percent in value on foreign exchange markets through 1985. The price of gold, interest rates, and inflation all fell as well from double-digit inflationary highs, while the American economy reignited and the stock market launched its 18 year bull market. Or, go back further in time. In May of 1962, President Kennedy's Revenue Act was passed and he reaffirmed that the U.S. dollar was as good as gold \u2014 thus launching the incredible boom called the 'Go-Go Sixties'. A strong dollar is an essential pillar of economic prosperity with minimal inflation, but we worry that the White House has not adopted this strategy. So we urge the Trump administration to return to the successful \"King Dollar\" policies that worked in the 60's, 80's and 90's. \u200eDevaluations and weak currencies do not create U.S. jobs. Instead, weakened currencies are accompanied by relative price changes, leading to inflation in the devaluing country. (Americans can, by definition, buy less with weak dollars in their wallets than strong dollars.) The stock market's big sell-off last week, coming after a weak dollar and rising gold and commodity prices, may well have stirred inflation fears and higher bond yields, coming on top of a healthy rise in real rates from a growing economy. But the dollar has still not strengthened, perhaps because the administration initially fumbled the ball in Davos. We also worry that the recent widening trade deficit numbers will further tempt the administration into a weak dollar strategy. The trade gap, or how much the U.S. imports versus how much it exports, widened by 12 percent last year, to $566 billion. This was the highest level since 2008. But the widening trade deficit is actually a symptom of Trump's pro-growth tax and deregulation policies that are working. The last time the trade deficit fell sharply was in 2009 and 2010 because of the steep recession. Trump was right when he once acknowledged the irony that his pro-growth tax and deregulation policies are partly responsible for a higher dollar that he seems not to want. But in fact, trade deficits are nothing more than the flip side of large capitals inflows from around the world. This is a good thing. Before long, the trade gap will narrow, as the U.S. becomes more competitive and the most hospitable investment environment in the world. A return to 'King Dollar' will bring a lot more jobs, wage increases, and investment flows back into the United States. It will confirm that, as Mr. Trump told the world's leaders and CEOs in Davos, Switzerland, \"America is open for business again.\" Looking forward, the administration should speak of a sound, stable, strong dollar. A great country must have a reliable currency. Additionally, if the dollar continues to trend lower, then the Federal Reserve should step in to retire reserves, and withdraw excess money. That leaves us with lower tax rates, strong growth, and a low inflation prosperity. And, if history is any guide, it raises the probability that President Trump gets reelected in a landslide. --The authors are co-founders of the Committee to Unleash Prosperity.

The start-up, which launched in September and is headquartered in Warren, N.J., announced Thursday it has raised $250 million in venture capital from global biopharmaceutical company Celgene, biotechnology company United Therapeutics Corporation, biopharmaceutical company Sorrento Therapeutics, DNA sequencing and machine learning company Human Longevity, Inc. and a collection of venture capitalists. The company also has a star-studded board of directors: Apple and Pepsi-Cola executive John Sculley, Google Ventures founder Bill Maris and the former commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Andrew Von Eschenbach. Celularity harvests the particularly potent stem cells from the placenta to make a number of medical products. \"Think about what we do as a form of a refinery business. Think of the placenta as biological crude oil. We do the discovery and drilling, if you will,\" says Dr. Robert Hariri, a co-founder and the CEO of Celularity, tells CNBC Make It.   Hariri is an engineer, surgeon, jet pilot and entrepreneur. He first started working with placental stem cells in 1998. His co-founder for Celularity, Peter Diamandis, is a well-known serial entrepreneur who founded the XPRIZE Foundation and another company in the longevity space, Human Longevity Inc.  Peter Diamandis (L) and Robert Hariri. Photo courtesy Elizabeth Lippman for Celularity \"My goal is to make it so the next generation grows up in a world where cancer is managed just like the common cold, and the body's natural regenerative engine remains empowered throughout our lives,\" says Hariri, in a written statement.  Stem cells are special cells found in the human body that are capable of dividing into and morphing into any number of specialized cells, like brain, blood or muscle cells. Other therapies using stem stells from places like bone marrow are already in use. Banking the stem cells from umbilical cords, for example, has been around for decades \u2014 Waltham, Mass.-based ViaCord has been banking umbilical cord stem cells for 25 years, according to the company's website.   But placenta stem cells are more valuable because they are more versatile, says Hariri. \"Placental cells are the source that eventually become umbilical cord blood,\" he tells CNBC Make It. \"We discovered placental stem cells and our intellectual property is vast. We have some 800 issued patents in this area,\" Hariri adds. His first company, Anthrogenesis Corp., announced its ability to derive stem cells from the human placenta in April, 2001. The Wall Street Journal and Reuters covered the news at the time. There are other companies working with placenta \u2014 for example, New York City-based Americord banks placental tissue, and Israeli company Pluristem Therapeutics sells products derived from placental cells \u2014 but Hariri says what Celularity is doing with placental stem cells is unique. Celularity has three main varities of medical products: biological repair products to help treat wounds, immunotherapy products to augment the immune system of patients with complex diseases and placental cell therapy products that augment a patient's longevity. The start-up is already selling the biological repair products to hospitals. Its biological \"Band-Aids\" are used to accelerate the treatment of wounds and burns resulting from injury or any manner of reconstructive surgery, and its injectable stem cell products can accelerate the repair of a tissue or organ. These restorative products cost from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars per unit, according to Hariri. Celularity bought its stem cell bandage business earlier in January when it acquired Alliqua BioMedical for $29 million, according to a press release.  Celularity's immunotherapy products are still in development. They will augment the immune system of patients fighting any number of complicated diseases, from cancer to Crohn's disease, according to the company. Currently, there other immunotherapy products on the market, like those offered by companies including Juno and Kite, which use various other cells and methods of attacking cancer. Those therapies cost $300,000 to $500,000 per patient, according to Hariri. They are expensive treatments because such products require cells be engineered specifically for each patient, says Hariri.    However, according to Hariri, Celularity is engineering placental cells that can be administered to any patient. \"Our approach is very different. We take placental T and natural killer cells, engineer those, so that they are available off the shelf, one size fits all, for cancer patients at the time of their diagnosis,\" says Hariri.  \"It is an inevitability that cancer will be treated by engineering immune cells. What we are simply saying is that the placenta as a source of those immune cells allows us to democratize this technology in a way that previously were not possible,\" he adds. That universality will also make the treatments less expensive. \"The potential is to bring the price down significantly lower because it is not a bespoke treatment for every person. It is a treatment that is created that can be provided to a multitude of people,\" Diamandis tells CNBC Make It.  Celularity also currently has the technology to harvest and bank placental stem cells. However, injecting the cell material to increase longevity in humans is still in development, according to a spokesperson for the company.  Stem cells are ubiquitous in babies and children but, as we age, they slowly disappear, says Hariri. \"In a child or young adult, these stem cells are in large supply, acting as a built-in repair system,\" explains Diamandis in a 2017 blog post. \"A useful analogy is to imagine your stem cells as a team of repairmen in your newly constructed mansion. When the mansion is new and the repairmen are young, they can fix everything perfectly. But as the repairman age and reduce in number, your mansion eventually goes into disrepair and eventually crumbles.\" According to Diamandis, \"the company's ultimate vision is to make 100 years old the new 60, providing people with maximal cognition, mobility and aesthetics as they age.\"  The potential market for products that increase people's lifespan is nascent but has the potential to be huge, according to Diamandis. \"The potential for this longevity business of adding an additional 20 to 30 years on your lifespan at the end of the day? It is a massive business because it is ultimately, people will desire to use their hard earned capital to not only live longer but live longer and healthier,\" Diamandis tells CNBC Make It.  Indeed, the global anti-aging market was worth  $127.9 billion in 2015 and is expected to be worth $237.8 billion by 2022, according an August 2017 report from Orbis Research. And the global market for cancer immunotherapy treatments was valued at $40.7 billion in 2016, according to an October 2017 report from Grand View Research.   But commercializing the science behind treatments for cancer and longevity run the risk of making them only available to the wealthiest individuals. That's how most innovative technology infiltrates society, says Diamandis. \"I deal with this a lot and the reality is, at the beginning of any technology like the cell phone, [It] is available for the wealthiest first. If you remember the first cell phones in the 1980s were briefcase-sized, then brick-sized and they were extraordinarily expensive and they didn't work very well. \"And what we see in every single market over and over and over again is, as they get better, they get cheaper, and so those cell phones that were paid for by the wealthiest in the beginning were extraordinarily expensive and didn't work well and now you can buy a feature phone for under $40 and you can microfinance it and children of Tanzania have those phones,\" says Diamandis. \"And so every one of these medical treatments starts expensive and inefficient and gets cheaper over time and becomes available to everybody.\" Of course, a cellphone is not the same as a life-saving cancer treatment. But Diamandis stands firm that the process of commercializing a product is ultimately good for society.   \"There is a huge amount of capital going in to do this and to make this available. That is what business does. It makes it cheaper faster better,\" Diamandis tells CNBC Make It. \"This is what capitalism and commercial industry and entrepreneurship is about making services better cheaper faster and that is what the company is doing.\" See also: Japanese scientists just used A.I. to read minds and it's amazing This former Google[X] exec is building a high-tech hat that she says will make telepathy possible in 8 years\n Ahead of Elon Musk, this self-made millionaire already launched a company to merge your brain with computers Like this story?

The CBOE Volatility Index, the most widely followed barometer of expected near-term volatility in the S&amp;P 500 , while not quite back to where it was before last week's slump in equities, has retreated sharply from the high of 50.3 hit on Feb. 5. The index was up 0.2 points at 19.46 on Thursday. Investors' fear of further losses for stocks has eased dramatically from last week, said Randy Frederick, vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. Still, investors are not as complacent as they were before the stock market correction, he said. \"When I see the VIX creeping a little higher today, even as equities are up, it tells me perhaps it overshot to the downside yesterday,\" Frederick said. The VIX futures curve, a snapshot of prices of futures contracts on the volatility index across different expirations, also painted a less fearful picture. The curve moved into backwardation over the last two weeks, meaning investors were paying more for near-term insurance than for contracts that would protect them farther out in time. That rare situation highlighted the extreme level of fear of further near-term losses for U.S. stocks. On Wednesday the backwardation had reached its most extreme level since Aug. 11, 2011, when rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded the United States' credit rating. With Wednesday's expiry of February VIX futures, the curve was approaching its more typical contango, where investors pay more for farther out contracts than for near-term contracts. \"Any time the front-month contracts expire, you immediately see a big adjustment in the curve,\" said Frederick. Wall Street surged on Thursday and was on track to end higher for a fifth straight session, led by Apple Inc and other technology stocks as investors shrugged off recent inflation worries.

Even a plucky comeback isn't enough for this market watcher to back the stock. \"It's a screaming sell here,\" Larry McDonald, founder of the Bear Traps Report, told CNBC's \"Trading Nation\" on Thursday. One major issue? Its billions of dollars in corporate bonds that could be the albatross around its neck as interest rates rise. \"Keep in mind Apple has one of the largest bond portfolios on the planet Earth,\" said McDonald. \"Apple's bond portfolio is bigger than many mutual funds.\" Apple has docked a large chunk of its overseas cash in corporate securities in recent years as it avoided repatriation. By the end of December, the world's largest company held $157 billion in corporate securities with most of that likely in fixed income instruments, up from $153 billion in September. As bond prices fall, and yields rise, those holdings become less valuable. Bond prices have been steadily in decline since the beginning of the year as inflation pressures increased and the chance of a more ready-to-move Federal Reserve grew more likely. At least 3 hikes to the fed funds rate are expected this year, one as soon as March, according to CME Group fed funds futures. McDonald also advises waiting for a pullback to more reasonable levels before buying Apple. At its current levels, he says, it \"makes no sense.\" \"The way I trade Apple over the years is every 18 months or so Apple goes on sale,\" he said. \"You have to wait for that moment for Apple. You can't chase Apple up at $900 billion market cap.\" Apple has held onto the title of world's largest company for years \u2014 it currently has a market cap of around $876 billion. Alphabet is the second-largest company with a market cap of $755 billion. Apple did see some weakness earlier in the year and briefly dipped into a correction, a level that represents a 10 percent drop from 52-week highs. However, its shares still remain near a record of $180 a share set on Jan. 18. Its relative strength index, a measure of how overbought the stock is, sits at 57.7 on Thursday, above the S&amp;P 500's 50 level. Phil Streible, senior market strategist at RJO Futures, agrees that Apple has too much risk to be deemed a buy, but harbors different concerns. \"Apple could face a lot of headwinds,\" Streible told \"Trading Nation.\" \"It's just too much company-specific risk.\" One fear, says Streible, is the potential for a protracted lawsuit tied to its admission of slowing older iPhone models. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed against Apple over a software update that affected iPhone battery life. However, Apple did say it had never intentionally shortened the life of its products. Apple shares have been on a run this week. Its stock has added more than 1 percent in every session of the past four days as it works to reverse losses sustained in last week's sell-off. In the week so far, shares have added nearly 11 percent, its best one-week performance since September 2016. It was down slightly in Friday's premarket.", "source": "https://www.cnbc.com/"}

And now that the stock has bounced back from recent lows, three of the company's advantages \u2014 popularity in China, a growing services business and a war chest of cash \u2014 provide a clear path forward, according to GBH Insights analyst Dan Ives.  \"[O]n the heels of a broader market snapback, we believe the Street is finally seeing the forest through the trees as the March guidance hangover appears to have dissipated,\" Ives wrote in a Friday research note. \"Importantly we estimate Apple has roughly 350 million iPhones that are in the window of opportunity to upgrade over the next 12 to 18 months, now it's about which model and price point 'strike a chord' for these customers to ultimately upgrade as the iPhone X demand has softened.\"  Ives put a price target of $205 on the stock, well above the $174 it was trading at on Friday. (Also above the average price target of $192, according to FactSet.) Apple shareholders have indeed been on quite the ride over the last month amid iPhone X worries. The company's shares whipsawed after fiscal first-quarter earnings were reported earlier this month. Guidance for the March was weaker than expected, and iPhone shipments were down slightly during the quarter. But, on the plus side, average selling prices rose, and executives shared more details than usual about the companies future plans, reassuring investors that \"iPhone revenue will grow double-digits as compared to last year.\"  Pair those mixed signals with an especially volatile market, and it's no wonder that Wall Street became a bit overwrought. But according to Ives, investors can now put all that behind them.  Ives expects three new iPhones to be released in 2018, models that will help capture any customers who were scared off by the pricey iPhone X. Plus, Ives wrote, Apple's \"unparalleled consumer franchise\" should help it woo owners of the 60 million to 70 million Chinese iPhones that are due for an upgrade. Apple is also investing heavily in its services division, which includes Apple Music, Apple Care and the App Store. Ives expects that business will hit $50 billion annual revenue by 2020. Then there's the cash \u2014 the hundreds of billions of dollars that Apple can now bring to the U.S. under a favorable tax plan.  Apple has said it aims to become \"cash neutral,\" which could mean huge dividends and share buybacks, UBS analyst Steven Milunovich wrote earlier this week. That outcome means more good news for investors, Ives said. \"In a nutshell, while this is a hand-holding period on the name, we believe near-term turbulence does not change our long-term bullish thesis on Apple,\" Ives wrote.
