That number has since tripled, forming a group of half a dozen tech companies worth at least half a trillion dollars that dominate the markets as their products weave their way into every facet of consumers\u2019 lives. All six companies \u2014 Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , Alphabet Inc.  , Amazon.com Inc. , Apple Inc. , Facebook Inc. and Microsoft Corp. \u2014 will report earnings on Wednesday and Thursday, and their size means the final tabulation of their 2017 performances will have an enormous effect on the market. The size of these companies have shifted the weight of the S&P 500 index , with five of them now accounting for nearly a quarter of the benchmark index, 22% to 23% according to , senior index analyst for S&P Indices. Alibaba is . Today, Silverblatt says, tech stocks are where the market\u2019s explosive growth lies, and that's what the current top-heavy index signals. \u201cTechnology is a growing area,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the quick and easy money.\u201d    Still, it is nowhere near the outsize effect of Big Tech during the dot-com boom in the late 1990s. Silverblatt pointed out that the top seven tech companies then accounted for more than a third of the index, 34%, dominated by companies like AOL Inc., General Electric Co. , International Business Machines Corp. and a company still in the top tier, Microsoft. Microsoft was the big dog back then, accounting for 4.92% of the S&P 500 index in 1999; Apple, the most valuable company of the current era, accounts for 3.63%. \u201cEven though we\u2019re top-heavy, it\u2019s not the same magnitude,\u201d Silverblatt said in a telephone interview. It is still top-heavy enough to make this week\u2019s earnings reports from the $500 billion club crucial. A combined value of more than $4 trillion is at stake heading into Wednesday and Thursday\u2019s raft of results: Microsoft and Facebook report Wednesday afternoon, Alibaba on Thursday morning, and Alphabet, Amazon and Alibaba on Thursday afternoon.          Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, said that the group\u2019s current stock prices are based on expectations that these companies will report huge holiday-shopping quarters. \u201cThe street is expecting clean beats,\u201d Ives said over the phone. Today\u2019s tech giants are well-positioned to continue to grow because of consumer trends as well as smart bets by executives, Ives said. And at least one, if not a handful, of these companies will crack the $1 trillion mark in 12 to 18 months, he predicted, throwing off any doubts collected along the way. \u201cEven though everyone is in love with them, the skeptics continue to wait for the fall,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they have phenomenal business models, great management teams, and a market that appreciates the potential for the next three to five years.

Stock's Rally Overdone? | InvestorPlace", "text": "Menu Gaining more than 40% over the course of a year is a fantastic performance for most companies, but for leading streaming service (NASDAQ: ) it\u2019s just a simple month\u2019s work. You read that right. Less than one month into 2018, Netflix stock is up a whopping 41%. And that\u2019s on top of the 55% return the stock enjoyed in 2017. As a member of the famed FAANG group \u2014 (NASDAQ: ), (NASDAQ: ), (NASDAQ: ), Netflix and (NASDAQ: , NASDAQ: ) \u2014 the company is often compared to the other technology darlings when it comes to performance and valuation. But in reality, there is no true competitor to NFLX. There is no other company even in the same stratosphere as far as popularity and business model goes. From a valuation perspective, NFLX stock is trading with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 62.9, which I\u2019ll admit does sound high at first. However, because of the company\u2019s above-average earnings growth, its PEG (price-to-earnings/growth) ratio is very acceptable at 1.2 \u2014 well below the market average. The actual earnings numbers are impressive as well. Wall Street expects the bottom line to come in at $2.66 a share in 2018 and explode to $8.83 a share by 2021. It\u2019s common knowledge that earnings drive stock prices over the long run, but when it comes to Netflix there are a few other metrics that investors also love to analyze. Subscriber growth is actually the most important factor for companies that generate revenue from subscription fees. NFLX added 8.3 million new streaming members in the recently reported fourth quarter, bringing the total up to 117.6 million. Management had previously forecasted 6.3 million new subscribers, so the huge beat \u2014 which included better-than-expected results both domestically and abroad \u2014 was a surprise to investors. It was also likely the reason for the big gap up in the shares after the report was released. Revenue is another key metric here \u2014 and for any company that is still in the early stages of having its cash flow to the bottom line. Netflix\u2019s top-line result was better than expected in the fourth quarter and showed growth of 32.6% year-over-year. It was also better than the third quarter\u2019s 30.3% increase. Accelerating revenue growth attracts money and therefore leads to higher share prices over time. Looking at the chart, there\u2019s no question that NFLX stock is overbought in the short term. But that shouldn\u2019t be surprising after such a strong and quick run. I do expect a brief pullback in the near term, but after that, the stock will once again be a buying opportunity. My long-term outlook is bullish on Netflix stock and I believe that reaching the $300 milestone is certainly possible in 2018.

According to , has been hard at work on four new iPhones. The devices include the following: OLED displays offer some significant image quality and speed benefits compared to LCDs, but OLED displays are harder to manufacture and there are fewer suppliers of them. Both factors ultimately make OLED displays more expensive than LCDs. Image source: Apple. Apple had previously been rumored to be working on three new iPhone models for 2018 -- one with a 5.85-inch OLED display, one with a 6.46-inch OLED display, and a lower-cost model with a 6.1-inch LCD. Two of the previously rumored models show up in\u00a0DIGITIMES Research's set of future iPhones (current rumors point to a as well as a in development), but this list seems to have two models that haven't really been talked about before -- the 5.7- to 5.8-inch LCD iPhone and the 6- to 6.1-inch OLED iPhone. On top of that,\u00a0DIGITIMES Research says that Apple is now leaning toward releasing two LCD-based iPhones this year (the 5.7- to 5.8-inch model as well as the 6- to 6.1-inch model) alongside a single OLED-based iPhone -- the one with the jumbo-sized 6.46-inch display. Apple had, according the report, previously been planning to release the two OLED iPhones as well as the 6.1-inch LCD model. Here's why these claims seem suspect. One of the best-connected Apple analysts is KGI Securities' Ming-Chi Kuo. According to Kuo, Apple is planning to launch two OLED-based iPhones this year -- one with a 5.85-inch OLED display (the same as the one on the current iPhone X) and one with a 6.46-inch OLED display (effectively a larger version of the successor to the current iPhone X). In addition to those two iPhones, Kuo also says Apple is planning a phone with a 6.1-inch LCD for more price-sensitive smartphone shoppers. Considering that Kuo has been steadily releasing detailed specifications of these devices for quite some time, and considering Kuo's considerable Apple supply chain connections, I'd be much more comfortable betting on Kuo's information than virtually any other analyst's. Admittedly the argument above might not be all that convincing to some -- I'm essentially saying that one source is probably more reliable than the other, but the reality is that sometimes reliable sources get things wrong and relatively unknown sources can get things totally right. To that end, I think it's worth thinking through these claims from a business/marketing perspective. Image source: Apple. When Apple introduced the iPhone X, it made quite a big deal about the work that it put into the OLED display that the device uses. On top of that, the lack of OLED displays on iPhones had been a competitive disadvantage (perceived or otherwise) for Apple for quite some time. The move to an OLED display and the significant marketing that Apple has invested in extolling the virtues of the technology make it seem quite unlikely that Apple would use an inferior technology on two of its three upcoming flagship devices -- again -- and limit OLED technology to a single premium model. Apple was forced to limit OLED technology to a single model in the 2017 iPhone lineup, likely due to cost and capacity constraints, but it's unlikely those constraints will persist into the next product cycle, especially as Apple brings (Apple has only a single OLED display supplier for the current iPhone X). Apple would be hurting its competitive positioning by not expanding its use of OLED display technology in the 2018 iPhones. The final thing to keep in mind is that iPhone development cycles are long and Apple relies on many suppliers for critical components. The reality is that because of the sheer scale that Apple operates at, it needs to work with its suppliers years in advance on technology development. On top of that, Apple's suppliers need to have some idea of how much component demand Apple will need for a product cycle well in advance so that they can build the appropriate manufacturing capacity. At this point, it's highly likely that Apple's OLED display suppliers ( and possibly ) have already been given some indication as to how much demand Apple expects for its 2018 iPhones. Those companies need to make sure that they put the appropriate capacity in to support the cycle. If Apple were to decide at the last minute to switch from releasing two OLED-based iPhones and one LCD model in 2018 to one OLED model and two LCD models, then that'd potentially leave Apple's OLED suppliers holding a pretty big bag. On top of that, there may not be enough capacity in place at Apple's key LCD suppliers to meet its demand, especially on such short notice.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha", "text": "Fiscal Q2 estimates continue to drop ahead of earnings. Do long-term holders care if growth is 21% or 25%? Don't forget the power of a weaker US dollar. Nobody should be surprised by the panic we are seeing when it comes to street analysts regarding Apple ( ) ahead of Thursday's earnings report. Not only is this a theme that seems to happen almost every quarter as earnings approach, but I started warning investors on the iPhone X back in December. Over the last few days, we've finally seen a large adjustment to analyst estimates, which has taken down the stock as seen below. But is this panic really warranted? ( I cautioned investors that analysts would take down their estimates , and that scenario is playing out exactly as I figured it would. The biggest pillar of this week's panic is a report that Apple is cutting iPhone X production to 20 million units in the current quarter. You can read all about that as well as multiple analyst notes on the situation . The chart below shows how estimates have accelerated downward recently, with still more than a day to go until Apple gives guidance for the March ending period. ( The current figure still is a bit misleading, however, something you'd know if you read my recent or some of my past coverage. This is because the high estimate on the street calls for more than $83 billion in revenues for the fiscal Q2 period, which is either a really bullish analyst or perhaps a typo estimate that should have been included in Q1. Taking this estimate out completely drops the overall consensus by about $600 million, which will make Apple's guidance look a lot better. I want to illustrate an example of how things could look for the March period, so to do that I looked at some of Apple's recent results. In the left box below, you can see the main highlights of Apple's March ending period from last year, and the right box shows the reported growth rates seen in the last quarterly report we have on record, which ended in September 2017. ( The iPad has been making a bit of a comeback, and Apple last year in an effort to combat soaring memory prices, so even in a bear case let's think about a 5% revenue increase, which is still only one-third of what we saw in the September period. Likewise, we'll assume a 10% increase for Mac revenues, which will be helped by . Services have been running around a 20% growth rate for most quarters (the 34% above was partially due to a one-time adjustment if you remember), so we'll throw that into the model. Other products also should do nicely thanks to the strength of the Apple Watch as well as nearly two months of initial HomePod sales, so I'll throw 20% in for a conservative growth rate there. That gets me back to the iPhone, which sold over 50.76 million units last year. Let's assume absolutely no growth, but that 20 million units are the iPhone X we are hearing about. I'll model $1,050 as an average selling price for the blended X sales, along with a $630 ASP for the other 30 million or so units, which is a drop of roughly $25 over last year. Combining all of this gets me to a revenue number of about $62.8 billion for the March period. That would be right in the middle of the predicted $62-$64 billion range for guidance from analyst Tony Sacconaghi, in on Tuesday. Again, however, some of those numbers seem fairly conservative. What if the iPad comes in with a 10% revenue growth rate, or the Mac comes in at 15%? What if services and other products grow more than I expected? I could easily add another billion or so to my base case. This also assumes that overall iPhone unit sales are flat. What if they grow even a couple of percent? Finally, there is one other major elephant in the room that nobody seems to be discussing in all of this: The weaker US dollar. The chart below shows a roughly 10% decline in the dollar index over the past year, with some currencies showing even more strength against the greenback than that. When foreign results are translated into US dollars, a weaker dollar helps Apple. If you take half of a $62 billion quarter (last year's Q2 saw 60% of sales outside of the Americas) and improve it by even 5% overall to adjust for a weaker dollar, that's over a billion and a half dollars right there. ( Here's the real question that investors have to ask themselves when looking at what Apple gives for guidance tomorrow. If you are a long-term investor, not someone just looking to make a quick buck, does it really matter if revenue guidance is for growth 19.1% ($63 billion) or 24.8% ($66 billion)? Does a few extra percentage points of growth in any one quarter really matter to whether or not you should hold Apple shares over the next 5-10 years? There are plenty of reasons to be positive on the future, like the massive capital return plan, lower tax rates, etc. Also, you have to take into consideration the pullback in Apple shares from $180 to $167 currently. As we get closer to Apple's Thursday earnings report, there is a full blown panic when it comes to the tech giant. Analysts are racing to lower estimates thanks to potentially poor iPhone X sales, but are they ignoring the bigger picture? Even if Apple guidance is in the low to mid $60 billion range, we're still talking about a revenue growth rate of around or slightly above 20%, which is very strong for a company of this size. Apple shares have come well off their highs recently, so you're not paying an all-time high for the stock. Those looking at the bright future might actually consider this pullback as one to take advantage of. I really don't think this panic is fully warranted, but what do you think?

We're still a day away from getting earnings news from  -- but one analyst isn't waiting for the shoe to drop. This morning, Canadian investment bank announced it is downgrading Apple -- ahead of earnings, but not necessarily of what it thinks Apple earned. Here are the three things you need to know. Image source: Getty Images. Let's start with the basics. BMO Capital lowered its outperform rating on Apple to market perform, and cut its price target on Apple stock by nearly 20%, to $162 per share. If BMO's right, that means that Apple at $167 and change today is selling for about 3% more than the stock is worth. Not coincidentally, this same morning we read in the pages of (subscription required) that getting its fans to ante up $999 to buy its top-of-the-line . Apple initially planned to build 40 million iPhone Xs in Q1 2018, says the . Instead, demand for the device has been so weak that Apple is cutting that production target in half, to just 20 million phones. (The situation could be even worse than that. quotes other sources saying that Apple has cut component orders for iPhone X by 60%, implying Apple could be missing its sales target by than half.) BMO believes that \"order cuts for iPhone X\" \"will push [sales] estimates lower for March and beyond\" at Apple. But BMO sees even bigger problems ahead for Apple stock than simply one underwhelming product launch. As the analyst explains, Apple's failure to get consumers to pay $999 for a smartphone may mark a \"secular change\" in Apple's business model that depends on convincing consumers (many of whom already own iPhones) to buy ever-pricier models. In BMO's view, iPhones as a family of devices may be approaching, or may even have reached, a ceiling at which \"prices will plateau as with the rest of the industry.\" If this is the case, then going forward, Apple may need to rely on selling more iPhone units to grow its profits, rather than selling mostly replacement iPhones at ever-higher prices. That could be a problem as BMO notes that Apple may be losing share in the important Chinese market. BMO believes that in the December quarter that Apple will report on tomorrow, iPhone sales were flat (by dollar value), and shipments down 9% (by units). What will happen if BMO is right -- if Apple is no longer able to hike prices but must rather \"plateau\" them on falling unit sales? And what will happen if this trend expands beyond China to the world at large? Even with higher prices (which BMO notes have been climbing steadily for \"10 years\"), it's worth pointing out that Apple's gross, operating, and net margins all began falling about two years ago. Annual operating margin has taken a particular hit, declining 370 basis points since fiscal 2015. Data from show operating margin was 30.5% that year, but fell to just 26.8% in fiscal 2017 (which ended last quarter) -- and are far below the 35%-ish margins seen in Apple's heyday in 2012. If BMO is right, Apple may have trouble using higher prices to counter this trend of declining profit margin. If BMO is right, Apple stock may have finally peaked."}

(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha", "text": "Amazon.com just became the most valuable business on Earth. You won't see it in the news. There's an explanation, and some other implications. This is a headline you won\u2019t read today, unless I write it. Yes, Amazon ( ) has just surpassed Apple ( ) for the title of \u201cmost valuable business on earth.\u201d Looking only at market capitalization, you wouldn\u2019t know that. Hence, you won\u2019t be seeing it in headlines elsewhere. However, a business\u2019 value isn\u2019t measured by market cap. Instead, it\u2019s measured by EV (enterprise value), which removes the effect from how that business is financed. It so happens that Apple carries a lot of net cash, whereas carries a tiny bit of debt, and that makes all the difference. Consider the following: Amazon.com surpassing Apple is in and of itself news. It also speaks about how differently the market values these two companies, and indeed how news impact them so differently. But more on that later. It gets old hat to refer to it, but Amazon.com carries an historically record price/earnings for companies this size. Never in history has the largest, most valuable busines raded for current-year earnings. We don\u2019t even need to look at the books to know that. Large, profitable companies during the dot.com years had trouble even reaching 100x earnings. This is a whole new page. Apple, for its part, carries a middling valuation. Unremarkable. Some will say it\u2019s cheap, some will say it\u2019s fair. It trades for 14.5x FY2018 earnings consensus. This valuation comes with the over-reliance on the iPhone. It's hard to build a higher multiple when the iPhone X gets on the news every day, with proclamations that it\u2019s under-performing sales expectations. Not that expectations have mattered much here. Amazon entered 2017 with . Right now, before it reports Q4 2017, those same expectations have been cut in more than half to $4.32. One can only wonder what would have happened to Apple stock if it had endured the same. To put it simply, over one year Amazon.com's shares were more than halved while the stock nearly doubled. The truth of the matter is that Amazon.com is perhaps the very first business to attain the largest-ever valuation entirely based on fuzzy hopes for the future. Amazon.com has two extraordinary businesses, AWS and 3P (Third-Party marketplace) retail. But it also has a tremendously unprofitable business called \u201ceverything else\u201d (though the overwhelming majority of it is first-party retail). The ethereal promise from these businesses has, for the first time ever, vanquished the hard realities of profit, as presented by Apple. Apple\u2019s $11.5 per share expectations translate roughly to $60 billion in expected profits. Amazon.com\u2019s $4.32 translates to $2.1 billion. The profits David beats the profits Goliath even though the odds were 28.5:1. Nowhere can the market\u2019s blind faith in Amazon.com be seen more clearly than how Amazon.com often reacts to news: Perhaps the market was mesmerized by this initiative\u2019s intent to be nonprofit. It immediately connected it to Amazon.com or something. Because as UnitedHealth was clocked, only Amazon.com\u2019s stock rose. Both Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan were down on the day. Are they the junior irrelevant partners? It wouldn\u2019t even seem that way, with Berkshire allocating Todd Combs to the initiative (by the way, is this a promotion or demotion?). In overall terms, my conclusion here is that Amazon.com is just the largest market capitalization company being inflated by a very obvious stock market bubble. A bubble now trying to compete with the dot.com bubble, and exceeding it in places. This bubble exceeds the dotcom bubble in: Having said this, this isn\u2019t a call to sell short Amazon.com or anything like that. Who knows how large the whole thing will get? While runs and runs, the fact is that its EPS estimates don\u2019t move. As a result, if its prospects have indeed become so much brighter during the last three months, then facing unchanged estimates would make for an easier beat.

Shares of Apple (   )\t opened slightly higher on Wednesday as the market gears up for the tech behemoth\u2019s fiscal first-quarter earnings announcement tomorrow afternoon. Apple\u2019s report promises to be one the most important events on Wall Street this week, so investors will definitely want to keep an eye on the results. Apple shares have dipped over the past week, primarily because of reports that the company\u2019s special-edition iPhone X is not selling as well as expected. The stock also experienced some volatility on the back of a Justice Department investigation into Apple slowing down older phones. But what does Apple have in store for investors in its Q1 report? Well, our current Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for adjusted earnings of $3.82 per share and revenues of $86.02 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 13.7% and 9.8%, respectively. Of course, earnings and revenue are just two of the many things investors will be looking at when Apple reports on Thursday. Investors will also be interested in how the company was able to perform in its key business segments. To prepare for this, we can turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file. The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts. Our latest consensus estimates show that analysts expect Apple to report total iPhone unit sales of 79.791 million, which would represent a 1.9% gain from the 78.290 million witnessed in the year-ago quarter. In the previous quarter, Apple sold 46.677 million units, up about 2.6% year-over-year. According to our latest consensus estimates, Apple is projected to post total iPhone revenues of $59.313 billion. This result would represent growth of about 9.1% from the $54.378 billion posted in the comparable period last year. In the prior quarter, Apple reported iPhone revenues of $28.846 billion, growing just 2.4% year-over-year. Apple\u2019s expanding growth rate in this category could underscore the higher selling price for the iPhone X. Finally, based on our most recent consensus estimates, we expect Apple to report Services revenues of $8.649 billion, which would represent growth of about 20.6% from the $7.172 billion posted in the year-ago quarter. The Services segment includes things like iTunes, Apple Music, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing. Last quarter, Apple posted revenues of $8.501 billion in this category, beating our consensus estimate of $7.613 billion and expanding 34.4% year-over-year. This was a record for quarterly Services revenue. Make sure to check back here for our full analysis of Apple\u2019s actual results tomorrow! Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world's first trillionaires,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early.

Apple is already responsible for creating and supporting over 2 \n      million jobs across the United States and expects to generate even more \n      jobs as a result of the initiatives being announced today. Combining new investments and Apple's current pace of spending with \n      domestic suppliers and manufacturers \u2014 an estimated $55 billion for 2018 \n      \u2014 Apple's direct contribution to the US economy will be more than $350 \n      billion over the next five years, not including Apple's ongoing tax \n      payments, the tax revenues generated from employees' wages and the sale \n      of Apple products. Planned capital expenditures in the US, investments in American \n      manufacturing over five years and a record tax payment upon repatriation \n      of overseas profits will account for approximately $75 billion of \n      Apple's direct contribution. \"Apple is a success story that could only have happened in America, and \n      we are proud to build on our long history of support for the US \n      economy,\" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. \"We believe deeply in the power of \n      American ingenuity, and we are focusing our investments in areas where \n      we can have a direct impact on job creation and job preparedness. We \n      have a deep sense of responsibility to give back to our country and the \n      people who help make our success possible.\" Apple, already the largest US taxpayer, anticipates repatriation tax \n      payments of approximately $38 billion as required by recent changes to \n      the tax law. A payment of that size would likely be the largest of its \n      kind ever made.   Apple expects to invest over $30 billion in capital expenditures in the \n      US over the next five years and create over 20,000 new jobs through \n      hiring at existing campuses and opening a new one. Apple already employs \n      84,000 people in all 50 states. The company plans to establish an Apple campus in a new location, which \n      will initially house technical support for customers. The location of \n      this new facility will be announced later in the year. Over $10 billion of Apple's expanded capital expenditures will be \n      investments in data centers across the US. Over the last decade, Apple \n      has invested billions of dollars in data centers and co-located \n      facilities in seven US states, including North Carolina, Oregon, Nevada, \n      Arizona, and a recently announced project in Iowa. Today, Apple is breaking ground on a new facility in downtown Reno, \n      which will support its existing Nevada facilities. All of Apple's US facilities, including offices, retail stores and data \n      centers, are powered by 100 percent renewable energy sources like solar, \n      wind and micro-hydro power, which Apple generates or purchases from \n      local projects. The new campus announced today will also be powered \n      entirely by green energy.   Building on the initial success of the Advanced Manufacturing Fund \n      announced last spring, Apple is increasing the size of the fund from $1 \n      billion to $5 billion. The fund was established to support innovation \n      among American manufacturers and help others establish a presence in the \n      US. It is already backing projects with leading manufacturers in \n      Kentucky and rural Texas. Apple works with over 9,000 American suppliers \u2014 large and small \n      businesses in all 50 states \u2014 and each of Apple's core products relies \n      on parts or materials made in the US or provided by US-based suppliers.   Apple, which has a 40-year history in education, also plans to \n      accelerate its efforts across the US in support of coding education as \n      well as programs focused on Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and \n      Math (STEAM). The iOS app economy has created more than 1.6 million jobs in the US and \n      generated $5 billion in revenue for American app developers in 2017. \n      With demand for coding skills stronger than ever, today there are more \n      than 500,000 unfilled programming-related positions across the country, \n      and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that by 2020 there will \n      be 1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants qualified \n      to fill them.\u00b9 To address the coding skills gap and help prepare more people for jobs \n      in software development, Apple created a powerful yet easy-to-learn \n      coding language called Swift\u2122, the free Swift Playgrounds\u2122 app and a \n      free curriculum, App Development with Swift, which are available to \n      anyone and are already being used by millions of students at K-12 \n      schools, summer camps and leading community colleges across the country. \n      Over 100,000 students and teachers have also attended coding classes at \n      Apple retail stores. Apple will expand these initiatives and add new programs to support \n      teachers and teacher training. The company is also increasing funding \n      for its ConnectED program, so students in historically underserved \n      communities have a chance to learn app coding skills and enjoy other \n      benefits of technology in the classroom. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the \n      Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with \n      iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple's four software \n      platforms \u2014 iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences \n      across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services \n      including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple's more \n      than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on \n      earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it. \u00b9According to code.org, there are currently 503,338 open computing jobs \n      nationwide.

Zacks Equity Research   Investors are always looking for stocks that are poised to beat at earnings season and (   )\t may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report. That is because Apple is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for AAPL in this report. In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at $3.86 per share for AAPL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.82 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for AAPL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +1.02% heading into earnings season. | A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more ). Given that AAPL has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see . Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Apple, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report. Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world's first trillionaires,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early. Our experts cut down 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys to the 7 that are most likely to jump in price immediately. For 28 years, the full Strong Buy list has averaged a stellar +25% per year.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system.

These returns cover a period from 1988-2016 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, an independent accounting firm. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month.

Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zack Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month.

(NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) - Treasury Bounce, Boeing Results Appear To Give Slumping Market New Life | Benzinga", "text": "The rate fear chills that helped send stocks to their biggest losses since last summer burned off slightly Wednesday amid sunny earnings reports and declining Treasury yields. President Trump\u2019s speech last night also seemed to give people confidence, and some really solid earnings from (NYSE: ) added to a more positive tone. Both BA and (NYSE: ) beat Wall Street analysts\u2019 estimates, and BA provided robust guidance. Shares of BA and LLY rose in pre-market futures trading. BA just continues to impress with its performance. Ten-year yields slipped to 2.71% early Wednesday, and earnings keep coming in strong. The market\u2019s sharp decline so far this week shouldn\u2019t be dismissed, but it isn\u2019t necessarily a cause for huge worries, either. To put things in perspective, the losses brought the major indices all the way back to\u2026 where they were about 10 days ago. Even after its more than 1% decline Tuesday, the S&P 500 (SPX) is still up more than 5% year-to-date. That\u2019s not bad for less than one month. Keep in mind that data continue to look good, with consumer confidence the latest positive report to show up. Friday\u2019s non-farm payrolls report looms large as the end of the week approaches, especially the wage component to see if any inflationary pressure might be shaping up. Consider the broader picture and try not to get caught up in any emotional trading. One thing that could be interesting to watch today is whether so-called \u201cbuy the dip\u201d action continues. In recent months, each 1% or 2% stock decline found buyers who saw lower prices as an opportunity. We might have seen some of that even on Wednesday, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) rebounded slightly from its lows by the closing bell after earlier falling more than 400 points. The VIX, the market\u2019s \u201cfear index,\u201d climbed to nearly 15 on Tuesday, near its historic average but way above anything we\u2019ve seen lately. VIX slipped a bit early Wednesday. Getting back to Wednesday\u2019s calendar, the Fed concludes its last meeting under the leadership of Chair Janet Yellen this afternoon, and that could help tame some of the wild market action and volatility we\u2019ve seen over the last week or so. Typically, volatility quiets a little the morning before a Fed announcement. Going into the day, chances of a rate hike were up a little from recent weeks, but with futures markets odds now at 5%, few expect any surprises. As always, consider reading the Fed\u2019s statement to get a sense of what Fed officials expect for the economy and any hints about how many rate hikes might happen this year. The Fed has talked about three, but some analysts predict four. There\u2019s now a 72% chance of a hike by March, according to futures. On the earnings front, key companies later today include (NYSE: ), (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ). With FB, it appears people might focus on the news feed changes the company said it\u2019s making as a response to community feedback saying posts from businesses, brands and media are crowding out personal notices. The centerpiece for MSFT earnings could be an update on the company\u2019s growing cloud-based systems and services. Baseball fans sometimes refer to the California Angels\u2019 stadium as \u201cThe Big A,\u201d and Thursday brings Wall Street\u2019s version as (NASDAQ: ), (NASDAQ: ), (NYSE: ), and (NASDAQ: ) (NASDAQ: ) all report earnings. Needless to say, it could be one of the most important days of the quarter, and a lot of focus could rest on AAPL amid widespread concern about the health of the iPhone X. Weekly U.S. crude supply data are due this morning, and Wall Street analysts look for stockpiles to build for the first time in more than 10 weeks. Crude is down sharply so far this week, partly because there\u2019s been a general retreat from riskier investments. However, rising U.S. production could also be playing into this, too, as some analysts look for daily output to climb above 10 million barrels for the first time since Richard Nixon was president. The energy sector was the second-worst performer of all sectors Tuesday, dropping about 2% as crude slid back below $65 a barrel. President Trump\u2019s State of the Union address offered a bit more detail on infrastructure proposals. The president is still talking about spending $1.5 trillion, though it sounds like a lot of that might come from state and local governments and maybe some private sector investment, too. Infrastructure spending can help lift stocks of building supply companies, but an overlooked factor is that technology firms can also potentially benefit, because infrastructure today is so technology-driven.  This year-to-date chart of the S&P 500 (SPX, candlestick chart), and the Nasdaq (COMP, purple line), reveal that the last two days of heavy selling took the indices all the way back to where they were in mid-January, just a couple weeks ago or less. That could help put things in perspective for anyone nervous about the sell-off. Data sources: Nasdaq, Standard & Poor\u2019s. Chart source:  As of the end of last week, the S&P 500 (SPX) had gone 564 calendar days since the conclusion of the last decline of 5% or more, the longest period without such a drop since 1945, according to research firm CFRA. However, many market sages might also point out that bull markets don\u2019t die of old age; they tend to die of fear. The fear stalking the market this week is higher interest rates, and that helped send the Dow Jones Industrial Average ($DJI) to its worst two-day point loss since Brexit in mid-2016. Amid all of this, keep things in perspective. The markets are down this week, but nowhere near the 5% feared by some. In addition, a 200- or 300-point loss in the $DJI \u2014 while it may not feel like anyone\u2019s idea of a picnic \u2014 just isn\u2019t as mathematically meaningful as it was even a year or two ago when market levels were much lower. Keep percentages in focus. It\u2019s far from unusual to see a 1% or 2% drop in the middle of a strong market. Earnings remain strong, and consumer confidence is high. Unemployment is at nearly 20-year lows, and bond yields are still historically low, even if they\u2019re up from the deep canyons they\u2019d carved over the last two years. All that said, investors should consider checking allocations. Hopefully, many people have already worked to re-balance portfolios that may have gotten stretched into bigger stock positions due to this long rally. It\u2019s certainly not too late to get started on that now, even if the market continues to fall. Prices are still near recent highs, and many investors are likely sitting on profits. Keep in mind your long-term and short-term goals, and also think about your sector allocations. If you\u2019re worried rates could keep rising, maybe it\u2019s time to re-examine holdings in rate-sensitive sectors like telecom and utilities. Those two sectors actually led yesterday, perhaps because they might appeal to people looking for more defensive places to put their money. Last year, Amazon (AMZN) shook up the retail sector with its purchase of Whole Foods. On Tuesday, the company helped shake up the health care market by announcing it would work with JP Morgan (JPM) and Warren Buffet\u2019s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) to form an independent company designed to address their workers\u2019 health care needs. Just like last summer when retailers dived on AMZN\u2019s venture into their industry, health care companies across the spectrum took a licking Tuesday when the AMZN news hit, and the health care sector fell more than 2% on the day. However, it\u2019s arguable that this was a bit of over-reaction. First, AMZN and its partners would be starting from scratch in an industry where it\u2019s very hard for new players to get a foothold. Also, it\u2019s unclear how AMZN and its partners would forge relationships with health care providers. It\u2019s not as simple as retail, where AMZN could buy a chain of grocery stores and just continue running them. Stay tuned, because the people behind this latest move have a lot of creativity and vision, but it\u2019s a little early to think established health care distributors and insurers face fierce competition from Jeff Bezos, Buffet and company. Yet.      "}

Most investors recognize  as the company that dominates PCs with the Windows operating system, owns the productivity software market with Office, ranks second in the cloud platform race with Azure, and sells the Xbox One, the second best-selling gaming console in the world. Analysts believe those growth engines will boost Microsoft's\u00a0revenues by 10% this year and 8% next year. But on its way to becoming one of the world's biggest tech companies, Microsoft missed out on many lucrative markets. Here are six of its biggest lost opportunities. Image source: Microsoft. When  launched the first iPod in 2001, the MP3 market mostly consisted of low-capacity devices that stored about a dozen songs. Yet the first iPod's 5GB drive was roomy enough for over\u00a0\"1,000 songs\", and it turned iTunes into the first major digital music distribution platform. Microsoft didn't enter the market until it launched the Zune in 2006. But the following year, Apple launched its first iPhone, and integrated iPod features and iTunes into its new smartphone. Meanwhile, Microsoft didn't support the Zune with\u00a0adequate marketing, and the product line was finally discontinued in 2010. When Apple introduced the first iPhone in 2007, former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer famously declared: \"There's no chance that the iPhone is\u00a0going to get any significant market share.\" Microsoft then stood by as 's  Google launched Android, a free operating system for mobile devices, the following year. Microsoft didn't release its first multi-touch mobile OS, Windows Phone 7, until 2010. By then, the mobile OS market was firmly split between iOS and Android, and\u00a0developers shunned Windows Phones. Microsoft tried propping up the business by buying 's handset unit in 2014, but that desperate move resulted in a writedown. Last October, Microsoft admitted that\u00a0Windows Phone was dead, and that it wouldn't develop any new features for Windows 10 Mobile. Without a foothold in mobile devices, Microsoft failed to follow Apple and Google into the connected car market. To project their mobile displays onto dashboards, Apple released CarPlay and Google introduced Android Auto. In 2014, Microsoft showcased its own mobile mirroring system, \" ,\" but\u00a0the concept never became a reality. Image source: Getty Images. Microsoft also lost the embedded automotive OS market to 's QNX. Over the past few years, Microsoft's OS for cars, Windows Embedded Automotive, was marginalized by\u00a0QNX, which controls nearly half the automotive market, and Linux, which controls about 20%. Those missteps could cause Microsoft to miss out on the shift toward connected cars as the next major computing platform. Microsoft entered the wearables market in 2014 with the Microsoft Band. The device, which was compatible with iOS, Android, and Windows Phone devices, was initially well-received in the US and UK. It offered a heart rate tracker, a GPS, a microphone, skin temperature and UV sensors, and an ambient light sensor, making it more advanced than many basic fitness trackers on the market. Its successor added enhanced Cortana integration, estimated a user's maximum oxygen capacity, and improved some of the original's features, but its\u00a0launch price of $250 was too steep for mainstream consumers. In late 2016, Microsoft discontinued the Band amid intense competition from rival wearables makers. Microsoft's Internet Explorer was once the most popular PC web browser in the world. But today Google Chrome holds that title with over\u00a060% of the worldwide market, according to Net Market Share, compared to just 12% for IE and 5% for Microsoft's newer Edge browser. Google's conquest of the web browser market -- aided by the dominance of its search engine -- greatly increased its access to users' browsing histories, and improved the quality of its targeted ads. The cross-platform convenience of the desktop and mobile versions of Chrome was also tough for Microsoft, which lacked a reliable mobile OS, to counter. Lastly, Microsoft responded slowly to the rise of smart speakers like  Echo and Google Home. Research firm CIRP recently estimated that Echo controlled 69% of the US smart speaker market, while\u00a0Google Home controlled the remaining 31%. Amazon's share would likely be even higher if other third-party Alexa-enabled devices were included in its market share. Harman Kardon's Cortana-powered Invoke speaker. Image source: Harman Kardon. Microsoft's approach to this market has been timid. Instead of launching first-party Cortana-powered devices like Amazon and Google, the company is relying on third-party partners like 's to release its Windows speakers. Microsoft hasn't technically lost this market yet, but that non-committal attitude could doom its efforts as other rivals like Apple's HomePod enter the market.

The question lingering in investors\u2019 minds is whether this cybersecurity company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 28.2%. So, let\u2019s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at 29 cents. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained nearly unchanged over the past 60 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $408.6 million, up 12.6% from the year-ago quarter. Fortinet\u2019s network security solutions include firewall, VPN, application control, antivirus, intrusion prevention, web filtering, anti-spam and WAN acceleration. The company\u2019s sluggish revenue growth rate makes us cautious about its to-be-reported quarter top-line performance. Notably, over the last five quarters, the company\u2019s revenue growth rate has been around 20%, significantly lower than its previous rates of over 30%. Additionally, Fortinet\u2019s third-quarter revenue guidance marks an even lower growth rate of 11.3-13.6%. The company observed that organizations have been breaking the cybersecurity investment plans into phases and implementing the same over longer periods of time instead of making a single large investment. Therefore, the above-mentioned factor is likely to affect the to-be-reported quarter revenues. The negative impact of the same will pass down to the bottom-line results as well. Nonetheless, we believe Fortinet\u2019s initiative to change its business model to subscription-based service provider will continue to drive the company\u2019s bottom-line results. Subscription-based service is a high gross margin business (approximately 80%) compared with the hardware-centric model. Notably, the company generates more than 50% of the total revenues from these services, which helped it generate a 170 basis points gross margin expansion in third-quarter 2017. We believe this strategy will somewhat mitigate the impact of lower revenues on the bottom-line results. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Fortinet is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our . Fortinet currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 which increases the predictive power of ESP. However, the company has a negative Earnings ESP of 0.10%. Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat: MSCI Inc. (   )\t has an Earnings ESP of +0.86% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see . Zendesk, Inc. (   )\t has an Earnings ESP of +9.91% and a Zacks Rank #3. Apple Inc. (   )\t has an Earnings ESP of +1.02% and a Zacks Rank #3. Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"\"the world's first trillionaires,\"\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early. Our experts cut down 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys to the 7 that are most likely to jump in price immediately. For 28 years, the full Strong Buy list has averaged a stellar +25% per year.

HomePod can also be used as a \n      speakerphone with iPhone for crisp and clear audio quality.

For developers interested in adding SiriKit support, more \n      information is available at .   Coming this year in a free software update, users will be able to play \n      music throughout the house with multi-room audio. If HomePod is in the \n      kitchen, users can ask Siri to play jazz in the dining room, or play the \n      same song in each room \u2014 perfectly in sync. If there's more than one \n      HomePod set up in the same room, the speakers can be set up as a stereo \n      pair for an even more immersive sound experience.

Earnings Finally End The AAPL Stock Rally? | InvestorPlace", "text": "Menu Source: Shutterstock (NASDAQ: ) is due to report earnings on Thursday afternoon. Suddenly, investors are getting nervous. and for good reason. AAPL stock is due for a correction. The market\u2019s largest company has been on tear ever since summer 2016, AAPL stock has soared from below $100 to $180. The most recent surge was predicated on expectations that the new-and-improved iPhone X would catalyze an iPhone \u201cSuper Cycle\u201d, the likes of which we have never seen before. But now that they are about pull off the sheets and see how well the iPhone X is actually doing, investors are apprehensive. AAPL stock has simply tread water since early November. That sideways action has turned into a sizable sell-off in the week ahead of the Thursday report. What is next up for AAPL stock? More downside. This stock got way ahead of itself on expectations that were unrealistically big. Apple will report earnings. The iPhone X numbers will disappoint. The March quarter guide will be below consensus. Investors will freak. The sell-off will continue. Valuation will compress. This is simply a must-avoid situation right now. The Thursday earnings report will likely be the catalyst which sends AAPL stock into full-blown correction mode. There have been murmurs on the Street for some time that the iPhone X didn\u2019t sell as well as everyone expected. Some news outlets have been citing sources familiar with the matter that weak iPhone X demand has caused Apple to slash production plans. Analysts have recently chimed in, saying that iPhone X numbers will likely be below consensus. But the most damaging preliminary read on iPhone X demand came from the Nikkei Asian Review and Wall Street Journal. The Nikkei Asian Review said, and the WSJ later confirmed, that Apple is cutting its planned iPhone production for the March quarter in half from due to much weaker than expected demand. That is bad news for Apple stock. AAPL stock has been bid up for the past year on expectations for the iPhone X to not only be the greatest selling iPhone ever, but to also catalyze a new era of must-have smartphones. The last time we heard this logic was with the iPhone 6 back in 2014-15. In both cases, investors bid up AAPL stock to an extreme valuation level (18-19 earnings multiple versus 5-year average of 14). Back then, the iPhone 6 was a huge success, but AAPL stock still sold off big time because the iPhone 6\u2019s success was not sustainable. This time won\u2019t be any different. Apple will report numbers on Thursday, and they won\u2019t be very good. The iPhone X didn\u2019t sell as well as everyone thought during the holiday quarter. And demand is weakening much more quickly than anyone anticipated. Consequently, Apple management will guide down for the March quarter. That will force investors to reset expectations for iPhone demand over the next several quarters, which will spark a valuation reset on AAPL stock. I don\u2019t think Apple stock falls back to its 5-year average earnings multiple of 14 because things at Apple are better elsewhere. Investors should consider the rebounding iPad and Mac businesses, or the burgeoning Services business. Plus, tax reform will provide solid downside protection. But if you assume that earnings estimates for this year will come down to $11 thanks to weaker than expected iPhone demand, and that the stock gets a slightly above average 15-16 multiple at the end of 2018, that gets you to a $170 stock in a year. That implies essentially zero upside over the next 12 months. This is a sell-now, buy-later type of stock. Right now, expectations need to come down and the valuation needs to reset. The Thursday report will give the stock an opportunity to do that. Once the earnings multiple has compressed to around 14 to 16, that will be the time to buy.

One tool for that goes beyond just examining financial metrics such as the is Michael Porter's Five Forces Model. Michael Porter developed the Five Forces method of analysis in 1979. The aims to examine five key forces of competition within a given industry. The main force examined by Porter's model is the level of competition within an industry. A person could even argue that Porter's model is essentially an analysis of the competitiveness or noncompetitiveness of an industry. The other four forces considered in Porter's model all impact the level of competition. They include the threat of new entrants to the marketplace, the threat of consumers opting for substitute products, the bargaining power of suppliers within the industry, and the bargaining power of buyers or consumers within the industry's marketplace. Through its Macintosh computers and operating system, the iPad, iPhone and other products, Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ: ) has achieved massive success as a company despite going through a number of up and down cycles since its founding in 1976. In 2014, Apple achieved the notable distinction of being the first U.S. company to ever attain a greater than $700 billion. Apple's success is attributed largely to its ability to innovate and bring unique products to market that have engendered substantial . Its product development and marketing strategies reveal an awareness of the need to deal with the major marketplace forces that can impact Apple's market share and profitability. A Five Forces analysis of Apple's position in the technology sector shows industry competition and the bargaining power of buyers as the two strongest marketplace forces that can impact Apple's profitability. The bargaining power of suppliers, the threat of buyers opting for substitute products, and the threat of new entrants to the marketplace are all weaker elements among the key industry forces. The level of competition among the major companies that compete directly with Apple in the technology sector is high. Apple is in direct competition with companies such as Google, Inc., the Hewlett-Packard Company, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and Amazon, Inc. All of these companies expend significant capital on (R&D) and marketing, just like Apple. Thus, the competitive force within the industry is strong. One thing that makes the industry so highly competitive is the relatively low switching cost. It does not require a substantial investment for a consumer to ditch Apple's iPad for an Amazon Kindle or other tablet computers. The threat of marketplace competition is a key consideration for Apple, which it has dealt with primarily through continually developing new and unique products to increase and strengthen its market share position. The element of low switching cost referred to above strengthens the bargaining power of buyers as a key force for Apple to consider. There are essentially two points of further analysis within this force: the individual bargaining power of buyers and their power. For Apple, individual bargaining power is a weak force, since the loss of any one customer represents a negligible amount of revenue for Apple. However, the collective marketplace bargaining power of customers, the possibility of mass customer defections to a competitor is a strong force. Apple counters this strong force by continuing to make substantial in R&D, enabling it to keep developing new and unique products such as the Airpods and the Apple Watch, and by building significant brand loyalty. Apple has been very successful in this area of competition, establishing a large customer base that, basically, would not consider abandoning its iPhones in favor of another smartphone competitor. The threat of a new entrant to the marketplace that could seriously threaten Apple's market share is relatively low. This is primarily due to two factors: the extremely high cost of establishing a company within the industry and the additional high cost of establishing brand name recognition. Any new entrant to the marketplace of personal computing or smartphones needs to have a massive amount of capital just to spend on R&D and manufacturing to develop and produce its own prior to ever bringing its products to market and beginning to generate revenue. Such an entrant faces the already identified strong competition within the industry that exists between Apple and its major competitors, all of which are large, well-established firms. The secondary challenge is establishing brand name recognition within an industry that already has several companies, such as Apple, Google, and Amazon, with very strong . Although it is possible some new company, perhaps a Chinese firm with financial backing from the government, might eventually challenge Apple's position within the industry, for the immediate future, the likelihood of such a challenger arising is remote. Nonetheless, it is important for Apple to continue strengthening its competitive position through new product development and building brand loyalty to place any potential new entrants to the industry at a larger competitive disadvantage. The bargaining power of suppliers is a relatively weak force in the marketplace for Apple's products. The bargaining position of suppliers is weakened by the high number of potential suppliers for Apple and the ample amount of supply. Apple is free to choose from among a large number of potential suppliers for component parts for its products. The industries of its parts suppliers, such as the manufacturers of computer processors, are themselves highly competitive. The switching cost for Apple to exchange one supplier for another is relatively low and not a significant obstacle. Plus, Apple is a major customer for most of its parts suppliers, and, therefore, one its suppliers are very reluctant to risk losing. This strengthens Apple's position in negotiating with suppliers, while conversely weakening their positions. The bargaining power of component parts suppliers is not a major consideration for either Apple or its major competitors. Substitute products, within the framework of Porter's Five Forces Model, are not products that directly compete with a company's products but possible substitutes for them. In the case of Apple, an example of a substitute product is a landline telephone that might be a substitute for owning an iPhone. This market force is relatively low for Apple due to the fact that most potential substitute products have limited capabilities compared to Apple's products, as in the example of a landline telephone compared to an iPhone that has the capability to do much more than just make telephone calls.

The sky-high potential of this market is well known already to many FinTech investors, and development companies in the sector that includes  (cse:GET),    and   The study, which used 2015 numbers (USD$550 billion) as the base year for analysis, expects a whopping CAGR of 39.1% through to 2020, . In terms of use widespread use of mobile payments, China far outdoes the US, at more than 50 times the current usage. Already, -so Western developers and marketers can see what is a possibility down the road. Widespread acceptance in China of major mobile payment platforms has led to major gains from developers of platforms such as Alipay from (BABA) and TenPay from (TCEHY)-which hold a 54% and 37% market share, respectively. In North America, however, though the market is already above USD$550 billion, there is still plenty of growth expected that will come with the adoption of easy-to-use mobile payment apps. Such apps that are changing the way we pay for everything from toys to avocado toast, include Google Wallet from  Apple Pay from  Samsung Pay from  and the fast-rising restaurant app Glance Pay from (OTC: ) (CSE: ).   Possibly the fastest moving of any sector in North America, in terms of sheer number of transactions, is that of the food industry. After the rollout of fast food brand Subway's stores with self-ordering kiosks that feature support for mobile payments, a survey was done to determine how many fast food eaters use mobile payments. According to the survey, it was found that had used mobile payment services in the prior month. Much of that comes from Asia Pacific markets, where 51% of respondents said they had used their phones to pay the bill in the month before. Those included the trialed use of \"smile to pay\" , supported by Alibaba's Ant Financial affiliate. While lower in comparison to their Asian counterparts, fast food eaters in Europe (32%) and North America (26%) are a consumer base that's higher than average in their respective regions for paying via mobile. Therefore, a more wide-scale adoption can be expected to come through the food industry, perhaps faster than through big-box retail stores, such as Walmart and Target which have also recently launched mobile payment apps for their respective chains. One company that is looking to corner the market on mobile payments in North American restaurants, is (OTC: ) (CSE: )-developers of the popular and secure app Glance Pay.   Diners are becoming more accustomed to using an app to improve their dining experience-whether it's . Convenience is key, and time is precious for eat-in diners-especially during the noon-day lunch hour, when no one wants to be busted returning late to back to work. Restaurant owners also want to , resulting in higher revenues during their establishment's prime times. The more diners they can serve in an hour, the higher the likelihood that their eateries will survive. In an effort to shave valuable minutes off of everyone's least favorite part of the dining experience (paying the bill), Glance Pay from Vancouver-based developers,  (cse:GET) is improving the dining experience for customers across North America. Streamlined and designed to revolutionize how we dine, Glance Pay is a mobile payment platform helping users choose where to dine, order goods and services, make payments, access digital receipts, redeem digital deals, earn great rewards & interact with merchants. Easy to use for both diners, and restauranteurs, Glance Pay is spreading wide across its home country of Canada and soon into the US and Europe in the near future. Already, popular chains and independent restaurants are adopting Glance Pay, including Ricky's Restaurant Group with almost 150 locations in Canada, and Canada with 52 locations across the country. Seeing Glance Pay as a brand leader-or potential Uber, or AirBnB of the restaurant industry- often ranked as InsTech's #1 FinTech Influencer in the world, joined the Advisory Board of Glance Technologies. \"I'm in love with Glance's simplicity and arena of business. In some ways it's like Uber, in terms of convenience. However, I think that its placement in the restaurant business is something that could turn into a huge success story,\" said Margaris upon the . At the time of Margaris's addition to the team in late September, Glance's stock was trading at $0.375-Since then, the stock has hit a 52-week high of $3.20. \"If they can replicate what they've already done in Canada, in the US and worldwide, it'll be a billion-dollar company,\" added Margaris. \"If it enters a major US centre at the beginning of next year, and executes in a popular state such as New York, I can see a $5 share price. The sky's the limit.\" In addition to Glance Pay's ease of use, it's the app's stellar security record that has further driven its widespread acceptance. As of November, Glance Technologies officially announced its fraud on the app. Further improving upon its anti-fraud expertise, Glance Pay has introduced its own cryptocurrency which corresponds with the app's built-in customer loyalty incentives for both the restaurants and the app itself. Much like the addition of Margaris, Glance brought in more expertise, through the , Dinis Guarda to the Advisory Board. Along with the appointment, Glance acquired Guarda's company Ztudium's cryptocurrency technology, . Much like the majors and their platforms, such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay etc., Glance Pay is gaining momentum across multiple outlets, in many sectors. However, its strongest sector remains in the food industry. Unlike for Apple, Google, and Samsung, investors in Glance Technologies still have plenty of blue-sky to look forward to, as they build out the brand either to market dominance, or being bought out by a major.      Alphabet Inc., more popularly known as Google, provides global online advertising services, as well as performance and brand advertising services. The Google segment includes principal Internet products, such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, Android, Chrome, Wallet and Google Play, as well as technical infrastructure and newer efforts, including Virtual Reality.

General Electric Company   Apple Inc. shares closed down 1.59% on about 51 million shares traded on Wednesday. The tech giant is preparing to roll out a new feature on its iMessage that allows users to directly chat with businesses through the platform. It's called Business chat and will be debuting this spring. The feature was initially announced last year at the company's Worldwide Developer Conference and will launch with partners that include Wells Fargo and Discover.

The company's Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller said, \"We've been notified by the SEC that they are investigating the process leading to the insurance-reserve increase and fourth-quarter charge, as well as GE's revenue recognition and controls for long-term service agreements.

The question lingering in investors\u2019 minds is whether this semiconductor company will be able to post a positive earnings surprise in the to-be-reported quarter. Notably, over the trailing four quarters, the company delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 18.3%. So, let\u2019s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter under review is pegged at $1.77, representing a year-over-year decline of 5.4%. We note that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter remained nearly unchanged over the past 60 days. Additionally, analysts polled by Zacks project revenues of roughly $531.8 million, marginally up from the year-ago quarter revenues of $523 million. It is likely that Cirrus Logic might have to pay the price of relying much on Apple (   )\t as the company generates more than 75% of its revenues through selling audio chips which are used in iPhone devices. This is so because various reports suggest that Apple\u2019s iPhone X sales remained below expectations in fourth-quarter 2017. The premium device received warm welcome from customers initially when it was launched on Nov 3, 2017. According to data from analytics firm \u2014 Mixpanel \u2014 quoted by Business Insider, iPhone X adoption was at 4.76%, better than iPhone 8 Plus at 3.59%, and iPhone 8 at 2.78% in November 2017. However, the device failed to catch up later due to significant supply constraint issues, which affected Apple\u2019s delivery schedules. Further, premium pricing \u2014 iPhone X starts at $999 \u2014 also lowered demand, particularly in cost sensitive regions like South East Asia. According to Nikkei, which was quoted by The Inquirer, Apple recently slashed its production target by half from almost 40 million projected at the time of iPhone X release. Apple has cited sluggish holiday season sales for its decision to cut production. We believe sluggish sales of iPhone X and Apple\u2019s recent decision to cut down productions of the device will thwart Cirrus Logic\u2019s third-quarter top- and bottom-line results. | Our proven model does not conclusively show that Cirrus Logic is likely to beat earnings estimates this quarter. This is because a stock needs to have both a positive and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or at least 3 (Hold) for this to happen. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our . Cirrus Logic currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and an Earnings ESP of -0.24%. Notably, we caution against stocks with a Zacks Rank #4 or 5 (Sell rated) going into an earnings announcement, especially when the company is seeing negative estimate revisions. Here are some companies you may want to consider as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat: MSCI Inc. (   )\t has an Earnings ESP of +0.86% and a Zacks Rank #1. You can see . Zendesk, Inc. (   )\t has an Earnings ESP of +9.91% and a Zacks Rank #3. Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"\"the world's first trillionaires,\"\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early. Our experts cut down 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys to the 7 that are most likely to jump in price immediately. For 28 years, the full Strong Buy list has averaged a stellar +25% per year. See its 7 best stocks now.   | No cost, no obligation to buy anything ever. Copyright 2018 Zacks Investment Research At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. These returns cover a period from 1988-2016 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, an independent accounting firm. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zack Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

The U.S. tech giant notified suppliers that it had decided to cut the target for the period to around 20 million units, in light of slower-than-expected sales in the year-end holiday shopping season in key markets such as Europe, the U.S. and China.\" The Nikkei report also stated, \"Apple is believed to have started considering an increase to proportion of liquid crystal display iPhone models by reducing production of the OLED screen models scheduled for release this year.\" Access RDI's Apple Inc.

On Monday MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson raised his 12-month price target on the stock from $245 to $320. Considering that this is a 17% premium from this past Friday's closing price, it had traders pretty excited. The analyst wrote in a note that his price target raise was a result of the company's fourth quarter earnings it recently released. Netflix had reported impressive subscriber growth and according to Sanderson, the company's subscriber growth could be still years away. He wrote, \"While there is certainly a bullish sentiment surrounding the stock, we think that many investors still underestimate the Netflix story particularly with respect to the penetration opportunity around the world.

This cost saving will ultimately boost profits. Further, Apple Pay has become a dominant NFC payment service on mobiles provider. The app now features peer-to-peer payments services. For the first quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from iTunes, Software and Services is pegged at $8.65 billion, up 20.6% year over year. China is one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets. In the fourth quarter, the company saw improvement in iPhone, Mac, iPad and Services segment in the region, leading to a 12% increase in revenues to $9.8 billion. This represented 16% of total revenues, after Americas (44%) and Europe (25%). Apple ramped up investment in the country. Per sources, the company has collaborated with local Internet services companies to establish its first data center in China. This was to ensure compliance with the country's newly implemented cyber-security regulations. Apple also appointed Isabel Ge Mahe to the newly-created post of vice president and managing director of Greater China. The creation of the post of managing director for China operations also underscores the importance of the market. However, anticipated slower iPhone X sales along with stiff competition from the likes of Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi can hurt the company\u2019s top line. Apple remains keen on India as it is predicted to become the second largest smartphone market.\u00a0 In the last reported quarter, Apple sales in India doubled year over year. The company has partnered with Reliance Jio and Bharti Airtel in the country and has also set up its first manufacturing unit in Bangalore, Karnataka. The company has teamed up with Wistron Corp. from Taiwan to take care of the assembly of the iPhones, mostly SE models. Further, the company is also setting up a couple of development centers in India to boost app development and to accelerate the development of maps. Apple carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A few better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Micron Technology (   )\t, Lam Research (   )\t and The Trade Desk (   )\t, all sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see Long-term earnings growth rate for Micron, Lam Research and The Trade Desk is projected at 10%, 14.85% and 25%, respectively. Last year, it generated $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce \"the world's first trillionaires,\" but that should still leave plenty of money for regular investors who make the right trades early. Our experts cut down 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys to the 7 that are most likely to jump in price immediately. For 28 years, the full Strong Buy list has averaged a stellar +25% per year.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. These returns cover a period from 1988-2016 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, an independent accounting firm. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zack Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

In addition to a visual overlay, AR may also provide audio and tactile inputs to the user, and rely upon presence and positioning technologies to present location-specific sensory inputs and information to the user. In this manner, AR represents a blending of information technology and media within a real-world environment for the benefit of consumer, business, and industrial users.    Download the full report:     The term Mixed Reality (MR) pertains to a form of hybrid reality in which physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real-time. With MR, either virtual objects are digitally mixed into reality or real-world objects are merged into virtual worlds. The latter case is sometimes referred to as Augmented Virtuality (AV), and is one step closer to Virtual Reality (VR), as real-world objects in a virtual world take on a sense of permanency with real objects, appearing to actually exist within the virtual world.  Adding to this sense of permanency, real-world objects in a virtual world may be digitally controlled. Conversely, MR may also support manipulation of virtual objects permanently placed in the real-world. In either scenario, MR will be an important aspect of teleoperation and tele-robotics.  The primary goal of AR is to enrich the user's perception of the real-world, providing information and insights that otherwise would not be obtainable. AR use cases have grown substantially across many industry verticals within the last two years, providing significant market momentum, and indicating great promise to transform communications, content, and commerce across a wide range of sectors. The goals of MR are broad, yet directionally focused on a true merging of real and virtual worlds, which Mind Commerce believes will be a major catalyst for wide-spread acceptance and usage of VR across all major industry sectors.

To get this column each market day, U.S. stocks are on the defensive, for a change, as an unusually strong month of January nears a conclusion. Against this backdrop, the big three U.S. benchmarks \u2014 S&P 500, Dow industrials and Nasdaq Composite \u2014 have dropped within view of near-term support, and the retests are worth tracking ahead of the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy directive, due out Wednesday. Before detailing the U.S. markets\u2019 wider view, the S&P 500\u2019s hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has pulled in to first support (2,853) from record highs. With Tuesday\u2019s firmly lower start, a near-term floor (2,830) is followed by firmer support matching the S&P\u2019s breakout point, circa 2,807. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has reversed from record territory. Tactically, its first notable floor matches the breakout point (26,150). Delving deeper, recall that the prevailing range bottom, circa 25,700, underpinned the Dow\u2019s mid-January bearish reversal. Against this backdrop, the Nasdaq Composite has topped just above the 7,500 mark, an area defining range top. Conversely, near-term support (7,377) remains an inflection point. Tuesday\u2019s early session low rests within three points. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has tagged the 7,500 mark, and pulled in from record territory. Though the nearly straightline January rally is longer-term bullish, near-term support remains poorly-defined. Tactically, the 20-day moving average, currently 7,272, is followed by support, circa 7,220, an area that underpinned the mid-month downturn. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has knifed to record territory, and remains near-term extended. Here again, the 20-day moving average, currently 25,792, remains a relatively distant inflection point. The Dow has not closed lower since November. This is closely followed by the 25,700 support, an area better illustrated on the hourly chart. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has also reversed from its latest record high. Tactically, the 20-day moving average, currently 2,788, is rising toward near-term support. The S&P has registered just one close under the trending indicator since Aug. 29. The major U.S. benchmarks are on the defensive, for a change, as an unusually strong January nears a conclusion. On a headline basis, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is vying for its first consecutive triple-digit down days for the first time in nearly one year following the worst single session for U.S. stocks since September. Meanwhile, the   So collectively, a consolidation phase has been long overdue \u2014 at least a sideways chopping-around period \u2014 and early signs are surfacing that one may be developing. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF has pulled in from record territory amid decreased volume. Recall that near-term support matches last week\u2019s low (158.20) and is followed by a firmer floor (155.80) matching the key reversal (mid-month) low. Meanwhile, the S&P MidCap 400 has also pulled in amid lackluster volume. Tactically, a near-term floor matches last week\u2019s low (359.20) and is followed by deeper support, circa 354.50, matching the mid-month low. Collectively, potential cracks in the bull trend have surfaced, though limited true technical damage has thus far been inflicted. Still, the prevailing downturn, to the extent one takes hold, is in an admittedly early stage. Tactically, three S&P 500 support points stand out: As always, it\u2019s the eventual retest \u2014 the response to support \u2014 that\u2019s worth tracking. The S&P 500 has registered just one close under the 20-day moving average since Aug. 29, and a violation would mark a change in character. The prevailing bull trend, on balance, has been punctuated by successful retests of well-defined support Beyond near-term concerns, the S&P 500\u2019s more important longer-term bias remains comfortably bullish pending a more technically aggressive downturn. The response to the State of the Union address, and likely more importantly, the Federal Reserve\u2019s policy directive, due out Wednesday, should add color. See also: The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names \u2014 sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see Drilling down further, investor concerns over rising interest rates have contributed to the prevailing broad-market downturn. Consider that the benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield has reached a 45-month peak, its highest level since April 2014. The upturn originates from major support at 2.62, an area matching the former range top, illustrated on the six-month chart. On further strength, the yield\u2019s next target rests at 3.04, a level matching the 2013 peak (3.036) and 2014 peak (3.034). An eventual close higher would punctuate a six-year peak, the yield\u2019s highest level since July 2011. More broadly, the yield\u2019s intermediate- to longer-term bias continues to point firmly higher. A violation of the breakout point (2.62) would place the brakes on yield bullish momentum. Also see the and Moving to specific names, Dow 30 component Apple, Inc. has pulled in to a major technical test ahead of its quarterly results, due out Thursday. Significant support matches three inflection points: Combined, Apple\u2019s floor broadly spans from about 165.00 to 166.80, an area that is under siege early Tuesday. Against this backdrop, Apple\u2019s relative strength index (not illustrated) has registered a four-month low, leaving it vulnerable to eventual downside follow-through. Based on today\u2019s backdrop, Apple\u2019s intermediate- to longer-term bias remains bullish, though the shares are tenuously positioned. The prevailing retest of support, and the response to Thursday\u2019s earnings report, should add color. Tactically, a violation of the 165 area would mark a \u201clower low\u201d (among other issues) raising a technical caution flag. Conversely, Intel Corp. is a Dow 30 component taking flight. (Yield = 2.4%.) As illustrated, the shares have gapped to 17-year highs, clearing well-defined resistance after the company\u2019s fourth-quarter results. The breakout resolves a double bottom, the \u201cW\u201d formation, defined by the December and January lows. Though near-term extended, and due to consolidate, the shares are attractive on a pullback. Support spans from about 47.60 to 48.10, levels matching the breakout point and the top of the gap. Looking elsewhere, the strong 2018 start has not been confined to the U.S. (Yield = 1.8%.) Technically, the iShares Latin American 40 ETF has taken flight, knifing to three-year highs. A commodity-fueled resurgence, partly has contributed to the region\u2019s breakout. Tactically, the nearly straightline January rally is longer-term bullish, and the shares are attractive on a pullback. Near-term support (37.80) is followed by the firmer beakout point (36.10). Similarly, the iShares Taiwan ETF is acting well technically. (Yield = 1.9%.) Earlier this month, the shares knifed to all-time highs, clearing resistance matching the November peak. The ensuing bull flag is a continuation pattern, positioning the shares to build on the steep rally from the December low. Support broadly spans from about 37.80 to 38.40.

Is it a tipping point for a slow-growing economy or just an easy public-relations win for firms eager to earn the applause of a mercurial president?    The answer will go a long way in determining whether the U.S. economy grows significantly faster in the years ahead and raises the standard of living for Americans. The new law reflects the most dramatic shift in how businesses are taxed since 1986. The top corporate tax rate, for example, was slashed to 21% from 35%. And a slew of related measures make it cheaper for companies to invest, especially this year. President Trump and his Republican allies in Congress promised the tax cuts would spawn more jobs, lead to higher pay, encourage firms to locate businesses in the U.S. and speed up economic growth. Extremely lofty goals, all right. Is it working? The early evidence is positive \u2014investment surged in Trump\u2019s first year in office \u2014 but it\u2019s still way too soon to judge, economists say. More than anything else, what the economy needs right now is higher business investment. The economy, powered by consumer spending, has grown steadily at about 2% a year since 2010. Yet that\u2019s well below the economy\u2019s historic 3.2% average \u2014 and weak business investment is the biggest reason why. The economy has basically been flying with one wing. Stronger business investment, in theory, is supposed to spawn innovation, help workers do their jobs better and increase productivity. Higher productivity in turn means companies make more profits and can afford to pay workers more. It's always been the key to a higher standard of living. The problem is, productivity has been usually weak since the end of the 2007-2009 recession. And so have increases in worker pay. Both have grown far more slowly than normal over the past decade. Yet investment began to surge after the election of Trump, the most pro-business president since Ronald Reagan, and the tax cuts could keep the money flowing. Business investment excluding housing, for instance, rose in the first three quarters of 2017 by the most in three years, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Strong business spending helped boost GDP growth above 3% in the second and third quarters.    Another measure of business investment known as core capital orders, meanwhile, began to surge early in Trump\u2019s first year in office. The 12-month rate of growth recently hit a five-year high of nearly 10%. \u201cWe clearly have seen through out last year in business sentiment surveys that capital-expenditure plans have increased,\u201d said Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo. \u201cA lot was on anticipation of tax cuts. I think we will see further increase in the rate of business investment.\u201d The broader question is whether businesses will invest enough, over a long period, to move the needle on the economy. Investment has experienced occasional surges since the end of the Great Recession, but they haven\u2019t been sustained. Carl Tannenbaum, chef economist of Northern Trust, is skeptical. Businesses scrimped for years despite historically low interest rates, he said, suggesting they didn\u2019t think many investments were worth it. Lower taxes rates don\u2019t make questionable investments suddenly more attractive. He also suspects many high-profile announcements of new investment \u2014 Apple and Wal-Mart come to mind \u2014 were given great fanfare to appease Trump. \u201cSome of these announcements were just ratifying investments that were already in the works,\u201d Tannenbaum asserted. George Mokrzan, director of economics at Huntington Bancorp in Columbus Ohio, is on the other side of the fence. He argues the U.S. needed to do more after years of inaction to help American companies compete in a cutthroat global economy.    \u201cWhen a company makes a decision on a large investment, taxes matter,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat tax reform has done is increase long-term returns from investments. And the more investment, the more stimulus for the economy in the long run.\u201d Stephen Stanley, chief economist Amherst Pierpont Securities, think the tax cuts might even be a \u201cgame changer for capital investment.\u201d He sees a boom in investment over the next few years that hopefully can drive a rebound in productivity. \u201cThat\u2019s been the weak spot for growth,\u201d he said. What might also help is the best global economy in a long time. , giving businesses more reason to spend and invest. \u201cA lot of countries are pulling on the same side of the rope,\u201d Bullard said.

Its phones were revolutionary, simple to use, and the desktop computer image and video-editing capabilities were unmatched. And while iPad Pro still is, in my opinion, one of the best tablet devices ever made, there are fewer and fewer reasons to stay within the Apple ecosystem. Most of it comes down to the company losing ground to its competition due to the lack of innovation, which is especially evident in the realm of smartphones. For example, Apple\u2019s current flagship, iPhone X, announced by Tim Cook as \u201cthe biggest leap forward since the original iPhone\u201d is by no means all that revolutionary. Its most highlighted feature, edge-to-edge screen, was already , most notably on the Samsung Galaxy S8, plus and Note 8, all of which came out before the iPhone X. Morever, this is the first time that Apple used the OLED screen display technology that has been a staple in the Android flagships since 2010 (Google Nexus One and Samsung Galaxy S1). One thing that separates good display quality from mediocre is the screen resolution, measured in PPI, or pixels per inch; the more pixels you have per inch, the more crisp the image looks and less \u201cblocky\u201d it is. iPhone X features 458 PPI, resulting in a 2436x1125 resolution. By comparison, , which is half the cost of has 2960 x 1440 resolution (571 PPI). Apple offers nothing spectacular in unlocking sensors and mechanisms department either. While iPhone X\u2019s face recognition (Face ID) solution might seem innovative at first glance, it\u2019s strikingly similar to iris recognition, a feature that Samsung S8 had seven months before Apple\u2019s latest flagship was released. Besides, Face ID comes with a slew of its own issues, ranging from recognition performance to privacy concerns. What about that ? You know, the one that sharpens the face and blurs the background, making it ideal for Instagram and Snapchat? That feature as well first originated on an Android device, most notably Huawei P10 released eight months before the iPhone X. There\u2019s also wireless charging, touted as \u201cradically different.\u201d Yet it\u2019s another feature that has been present on smartphone devices since 2009 and is available in the majority of flagship Android smartphones. Finally, the price tag: . For that amount of money, you can buy Samsung S8 phone with 64GB of internal and , and you\u2019ll still save $60. On top of that. Samsung phone offers a slew of features you won\u2019t find on your iPhoneX, including:  . It allows you to expand the storage on your phone up to 256GB. On your iPhone, you\u2019ll either delete the apps or buy a more expensive model with larger storage.  No need to spend extra $10 just to plug your headphones in.  Don\u2019t want to use Face ID or a regular password? Try the fingerprint sensor, or perhaps shape lock. Want something that works like Face ID? Try Samsung\u2019s iris recognition.  I love virtual reality and what Samsung did with its VR mobile platform. iPhone doesn\u2019t natively support VR.     I love using these after my daily exercise. I could get a smartwatch or a FitBit-like device, but why spend extra money when I can get my daily score from one device? If you have an iPhone, be prepared to spend extra on a wearable that can track these metrics.  Using a special dock, dubbed , you can attach your phone to a monitor, add keyboard and a mouse and use it like you would a desktop computer. I see this useful in scenarios where you need to type a lot, have a screen at hand (any hotel LCD will do) and don\u2019t want the hassle of buying a laptop/tablet. Aside from mirroring your iPhone screen to your TV, iPhone doesn\u2019t have a similar option.  Siri is cool, but For example, it makes your phone smarter, especially the camera: It is able to recognize taken photos and associate them with relevant information, such as product or location information.  Anything from changing the screen resolution to throttling your phone\u2019s processor and more can be customized to squeeze as much extra juice from your S8 as possible \u2014 enough to make that emergency phone call or to last until the end of the commute. iPhone has only two options: low power mode toggle and shutting down apps. Full disclosure: I own both an iPhone 7 and a Samsung Galaxy S8+. Remember that Apple losing its innovation edge has been a long time coming. I started noticing it from the day that first Apple Watch was introduced and the company insisted on . Then the gold and ceramic finishes came out. At that point, I realized the innovation era was over. The Apple device had become more about style and much less about the substance. While this approach will boost sales for a certain group of customers, it won\u2019t work favorably for the Cupertino giant in the long term. Investors shouldn\u2019t be surprised by reports of \u2014 and in fact could get confirmation when .    KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo predicts that Apple may \u201ckill off\u201d the iPhone X this summer due to the poor sales. That goes hand in hand with the survey made by CIRP (Consumer Intelligence Report Partners), which states that both iPhone X and iPhone 8 accounted for only 61% of U.S. iPhone sales in the December 2017 fiscal quarter. By comparison, iPhone 7 models alone accounted for 71% of U.S. iPhone sales a year earlier. Although the analyst feels the end of iPhone X is due to the failing to win over the Chinese customers, I think this is just the beginning of a trend (remember, the \u201cnotchless\u201d iPhone 8 didn\u2019t boost the sales either). So there you have it. In an age where innovation is the key and where technology improves daily in leaps and bounds, it\u2019s naive to assume company\u2019s growth can be sustained by rapidly changing the market focus to a smaller segment of buyers that appreciates the \u201cbling\u201d more than functionality. In the end, the company may earn more per unit, but will sell fewer units and even worse, it may lose favor with existing customers. If the current trend keeps up, I believe Apple is up for a slow but continuous decline. If the company wants to get back on track, it needs to start noticing the competition, working on its feature set and reclaiming the title of the innovation leader it once had.

The Suwon, South Korea-based tech company said fourth-quarter net profit rose 42% to 12.26 trillion South Korean won ($11.4 billion) from 7.09 trillion won a year earlier. The world's largest smartphone maker said revenue rose to 65.98 trillion won from 53.33 trillion won a year earlier. Operating profit was 15.15 trillion won, an all-time high. Samsung also approved a 50-to-1 stock split in response to claims that its \"high share price was a hindrance to potential investors.\" Samsung shares rose 4.6% early Wednesday in Seoul to 2,607,000 won. The company's shares have risen about 26% over the past year. The company's smartphone shipments fell in the fourth quarter from the third. Operating profit for the mobile handset division fell slightly to 2.42 trillion won from 2.50 trillion won a year earlier. Samsung blamed higher marketing costs for the decline. Samsung's flagship devices, like the Galaxy Note 8, which compete with Apple Inc.'s iPhone, saw sales increase, the company said. The Galaxy Note 8 and the new iPhone X pushed phone prices up to the $1,000 mark, testing whether consumers would pay premiums for the latest gadgets. On Tuesday, The Wall Street Journal reported that Apple is cutting planned production for the iPhone X for the three-month period ending March 31, a sign of weaker-than-expected demand. Not long ago, smartphones were Samsung's cash cow. But the bulk of profits now come from memory chips because of the proliferation of internet-connected devices and servers. That has helped Samsung to keep profits up despite a leadership vacuum. The company's de facto leader is behind bars, its chairman is incapacitated and it replaced its three CEOs in the fall. Samsung awaits an appeals-court verdict next week for Lee Jae-yong, the grandson of the company's founder, who was convicted in August for bribing South Korea's former president and sentenced to five years in prison. Mr. Lee has denied wrongdoing. But the firm's financial results are in order. Samsung has benefited from a surge in memory chip prices because only a few large semiconductor makers remain after a decade of consolidation. Analysts refer to the current phase as a memory-chip \"supercycle\" that should remain strong through this year, though some believe it has peaked. The prices of two main types of memory chips--where Samsung is the largest producer--have more than doubled over the past two years, according to DRAMeXchange. For the full year, Samsung racked up an operating profit of 53.65 trillion won and revenue of 239.58 trillion won in 2017. Samsung sought to extend its lead in semiconductors by spending $44 billion on capital expenditures in 2017--more than any other publicly traded company last year, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence estimates. Consumers were mostly undeterred from an embarrassing global recall of Galaxy Note 7 devices in 2016, a debacle that cost it about $6.5 billion. Initial sales of its flagship phones, the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy Note 8, were among the strongest in Samsung's history, the company has said. Samsung's washing machine sales in the U.S. face a challenge from new tariffs approved last week by the Trump administration. LG Electronics Inc., Samsung's South Korean rival, told retailers last week it would raise prices on laundry appliances. Samsung has said it was reviewing the matter but has given no indication on future pricing. While the business unit that includes washing machines and other home appliances represents about a sixth of Samsung's revenue, it accounted for less than 5% of operating profit in recent quarters.

He changed the way people shop. Shoppers are bombarded by tricks worthy of a magician when they walk into a store and, some at least, are growing wise to them. Kamprad mastered the art of cheap, do-it-yourself furniture, and turned what could be seen as a chore \u2014 putting together your own wardrobes and bookshelves, and choosing the parts yourself in a vast warehouse \u2014 into an experience.    IKEA has approximately 400 stores worldwide and aims to generate $62 billion in sales by 2020, but it somehow remains a consumer-friendly symbol of humble living where people try to make the most of small spaces with simple furniture. Kamprad once said, \u201cI could have an office all to myself but since my collaborators don\u2019t have one, then I too am contented to have a desk in a shared room.\u201d Here are 10 ways IKEA helped change the face of shopping:    It\u2019s not possible to get lost in IKEA, but it\u2019s eminently possible to spend all day in one store. Not many retailers can lay claim to that. Marketing consultant Martin Lindstrom, author of \u201c ,\u201d has rules to avoid overspending. Rule No. 1: \u201cDon\u2019t bring your kids with you,\u201d he says. They\u2019ll help you spend 29% more than your budget, according to a study of nearly 3,000 consumers Lindstrom carried out. No. 2: \u201cDon\u2019t shop with your partner,\u201d he says. He or she will make you spend 19% more than planned. No. 3: \u201cDon\u2019t use a shopping cart. People who carry their stuff spend 8% less.\u201d   Why not send a message that your company cares about the environment and \u2014 at the same time \u2014 ensure customers hit the stores armed with an empty bag? IKEA, Wal-Mart and Whole Foods are among the many retailers that offer reusable shopping bags or large trolleys. The bags sometimes even bear the company\u2019s logo, providing free advertising for the store. (IKEA\u2019s are instantly recognizable even without a logo.) But mainly the bags create a void that needs to be filled, encouraging consumers to buy more than they need, says Johan Stenebo, author of the book \u201cThe Truth About IKEA.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why they\u2019re so big,\u201d he says. (IKEA, Wal-Mart and Whole Foods did not respond to requests for comment.)   IKEA has been named one of Fortune\u2019s top 20 best workplaces, citing the benefits and opportunities for advancement. Happy staff are helpful staff. Graphic designer Daniel Drenger said he once went to IKEA with a friend and ended up with a trolley full of soft furnishings and various accessories for his home. He hadn\u2019t intended to shop, but everything was laid out so well and the staff was so welcoming and friendly, he said. It was almost like stepping into someone else\u2019s home. \u201cCustomers want more meaningful experiences,\u201d says Derrick Daye, managing director at Los Angeles-based consultancy The Blake Project. The overly-friendly staff are trying to fulfill that desire, he says.   IKEA provides a winding path through the store punctuated with relaxing spaces for weary shoppers to rest their feet. Don\u2019t loiter too long though: These rest areas are often placed next to displays of products that stores want to unload, says Stenebo, who worked at IKEA from 1988 to 2008 in a variety of roles from product development to management, and is also the former assistant to the group\u2019s founder, the late Ingmar Kamprad. \u201cRetailers call this the hot-hot-hot spot for inventory that\u2019s not shifting,\u201d he says. That said, IKEA is a destination store usually situated on the outskirts of a city, and not a department store where people pop into for five or 10 minutes while running errands. That\u2019s why they sell you meatballs after you\u2019ve finished your shopping.   The \u201ccompromise price effect\u201d is most often used by discount retailers and electronics stores that want customers to pay extra for a better camera or computer, but it\u2019s also used effectively at IKEA too, says Michelle Barnhart, associate professor of marketing at Oregon State University College of Business. Here\u2019s how it works: If a $225 sofa is strategically placed next to a slightly cheaper \u2014 but very similar \u2014 $195 sofa, the customer might be tempted to opt for the latter and walk away still believing that he or she got a good deal. The \u201ccompromise price effect\u201d can be effective in a store or even online, she says.   Nobody believes they\u2019ll be persuaded to buy something simply because it\u2019s priced $9.99 instead of $10, but studies say otherwise. It\u2019s called the \u201cleft-digit effect.\u201d The difference of one cent can turn a window shopper into an actual shopper, according to a 2009 study by researchers at Colorado State University and Washington State University, published in the Journal of Consumer Research. In one test, the researchers asked participants to evaluate two identical pens: They priced one at $2.00 and the other $3.99 \u2014 amazingly, 44% of the participants chose the higher-priced pen. IKEA has a range of cost at $129, $79, $249, $349. And when they\u2019re reduced? The numbers are even odder: reduced from $349 to $343.   The influence of IKEA can be most starkly seen at the Apple Store as well as other electronic outlets from Best Buy to Microsoft Apple Store employees are among the most successful at solving your problems, says Carmine Gallo, author of \u201cThe Apple Experience: Secrets to Building Insanely Great Customer Loyalty.\u201d Apple\u2019s \u201cgenius bar\u201d is a team of sales people designed to solve problems and empower the customer rather than (just) make sales, he says. It\u2019s been paying off: There are roughly more than 500 million visits to Apple retail stores per year, according to market researcher Asymco; that\u2019s roughly equivalent to the population of the European Union. However, more than 780 million customers visit IKEA stores every year.   Beware of the bags of tea lights, candles and multicolored plastic toilet brushes positioned next to the IKEA entrance. They are designed to break a psychological barrier and get consumers shopping, independent retail consultant Jeff Green. In retail parlance, they\u2019re \u201copen-the-wallet\u201d items and they often appear as an elaborate and random display. Displays could include everything from plastic to-go cups to eye-catching rubber spatulas. U.S. retailers have also taken the \u201copen-the-wallet\u201d concept to a whole new level by promoting cheap stuff in October in the hope that people will keep shopping in November and December. \u201cAmericans are cautious,\u201d Green says, so they need a little extra push to get them in the mood to spend money.   There\u2019s a reason a minimalist design works at IKEA and Apple, but this turns off regular shoppers in a store like J.C. Penney IKEA sells inexpensive furniture that is simply displayed to show how easy it will fit into your home, while J.C. Penney is a promotional store where people enjoy the voyage the bottom of the bargain basement, Shelton says. \u201cBig box department stores make you dig around and see what\u2019s on sale,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople feel like they\u2019re on a treasure hunt and finding a bargain that someone else missed.\u201d (Music is used to either keep people moving briskly through the store or to slow them down, depending on how busy they are, according to an of big supermarkets by Casino.org. Plus, there\u2019s no free shelf space at the checkout, leaving no room to dump unwanted items.)   Buying toys for kids can be a gift that keeps on giving: IKEA will sell you one size of plastic container for all the stuff you bought, but maybe don\u2019t need, and it will have one in every shape and size to fit into all the awkward nooks and crannies at home. Another example: The battery life of Apple\u2019s iPhones has long been a bugbear for Apple fans. Apple sells a Mophie Juice Pack Plus charger case ($120), which doubles the time to talk, text and surf the Web. Ingvar Kamprad took a leaf out of Lieutenant Columbo\u2019s playbook, Shelton says, \u201cThere will always be \u2018Just one more thing.\u2019\u201d Or, in fact, maybe it was the other way around.

The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, that Apple is slashing the planned production of the gadget due to slow demand. \u201cApple plans to make about 20 million iPhone X handsets in the first quarter, down from roughly 40 million initially planned, according to a person with knowledge of Apple\u2019s production goals,\u201d the paper reported. The iPhone X was released on Nov. 3, 2017. \u201cApple has lost their way in the marketing of the iPhone X and iPhone 8,\u201d said technology consultant Jeff Kagan. \u201cIt should have made both the iPhone 8 and iPhone X available at the same time.\u201d Sinolink Securities Co. analyst Zhang Bin, said the $1,000 price for the iPhone X may cut into first-quarter demand. \u201cAfter the first wave of demand has been fulfilled, the market now worries that the high price of the iPhone X may weaken demand in the first quarter,\u201d he wrote, . (Apple did not respond to request for comment.)       Apple has also had some negative press lately, with some reports alleging that Apple replaces old iPhones with slower batteries. \u201cThe reasons are less malicious than some conspiracy theorists postulated, though the effect on the consumer experience remains the same,\u201d Ryan Shrout, founder and lead analyst at Shrout Research, . \u201cApple was forced down this road after iPhones began shutting off unexpectedly during periods of heavy load, from simply opening an app or starting the camera,\u201d he added.   The iPhone X has several new features to lure customers. You can use facial recognition technology to open the phone, it has wireless charging with a wireless charging mat and the camera is than previous iPhone models. Despite the new features, some experts believe Apple is pushing customers too far and too fast with increasingly expensive upgrades. The $1,000 is a big ask. Customers are now paying as much for a phone as they have traditionally paid for a laptop \u2014 and most people are not upgrading their laptops every two years. The upgrade rate has extended along with the length of the installment plans: 30 months rather than 24, some . There\u2019s a limit to people\u2019s excitement, said Julie Ask, an analyst with Forrester Research. \u201cMaybe the upgrade rate won\u2019t be as frequent.\u201d    People were confused about the branding. Apple is part technology company, part lifestyle brand, part social signifier and, yes, part luxury goods company. However, many people don\u2019t even know whether to call it the \u201cX\u201d or the \u201c10.\u201d At the iPhone\u2019s launch, CEO Tim Cook said the iPhone X should be called the \u201c10,\u201d to mark the 10th anniversary of the first iPhone. However, there was no explanation as to . That was a rare piece of confusing over Apple branding.   How much is too much for a phone that costs as much as many laptops? \u201cIt\u2019s bold,\u201d Ask added. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit audacious. But there\u2019s evidence they serve a more affluent base than Android.\u201d  Some 77% of people with an annual income under $20,000 don\u2019t own an Apple device versus 65% for people without an Android device in the same income bracket, according to , a digital consumer analysis company. The percentage of people without an Apple device drops to 39% for those earning $150,000 a year or more, but 59% still didn\u2019t have an Android in that income bracket. Affluent Apple customers .   \u201cApple has not lost the plot, and the price tag will not hold back demand for iPhone X,\u201d said Vincent Thielke, research analyst at research firm Canalys. \u201cApple will sell every unit of iPhone X it can make in the next six months. The iPhone is not a necessity, it is a luxury. Apple customers grow increasingly locked into its ecosystem, with apps, cloud storage, mobile pay, music subscriptions, and proprietary smartwatches.\u201d That growing ecosystem gives Apple many ways to sweeten the deal, just like car manufacturers entice customers with freebies. \u201cIf Apple wanted to lower the price of the device, it would find a way with free subscriptions to Apple Music and gift cards \u2014 just like General Motors does with zero financing.\u201d   What\u2019s more, Apple has gradually prepared customers for the $1,000 psychological price point. Neil Mawston, analyst at Strategy Analytics, estimates the global average wholesale trade price of an iPhone has almost doubled to $650 in 2017 from $387 in 2007. \u201cThe $1,000 iPhone X is just another step in Apple\u2019s long-term strategy to increase, not decrease, pricing,\u201d he said. \u201cApple fans and critics complain about high iPhone pricing every year, but still go out and buy tens of millions of them.\u201d \u201cApple is pushing the upper limits of consumer acceptance with a $1,000 iPhone X, but it remains relatively affordable to affluent city workers in places like New York or London who can purchase the device on monthly leasing plans,\u201d Mawston said. \u201cWhen paid off monthly in smaller chunks, the iPhone X feels much less expensive.\u201d Those chunks remain somewhat consistent on Apple\u2019s 30-month payment plan, or with two-year subsidized plans through carriers like AT&T Verizon and T-Mobile  This advertisement is provided by Bankrate, which compiles rate data from more than 4,800 financial institutions.

Much of  quarter has been dominated by what has become a hostile takeover attempt by  to acquire the company. Recently, Qualcomm made a pitch for its value as a stand-alone company, announcing a $1 billion cost-reduction program and forecast adjusted earnings of $6.75 to $7.50 a share for fiscal 2019.

Estimize, a software platform that uses crowdsourcing from hedge-fund executives, brokerages, buy-side analysts and others, calls for earnings of 93 cents a share.  Wall Street expects revenue of $5.92 billion from Qualcomm, according to 14 analysts polled by FactSet. That\u2019s up from the $5.89 billion forecast at the beginning of the quarter. Qualcomm predicted revenue of $5.5 billion to $6.3 billion. Estimize expects revenue of $6 billion.  Qualcomm shares are up 4.6% for the year, following a 1.8% decline in 2017. In comparison, the PHLX Semiconductor Index is up 7.8% this year, and gained 38% in 2017, while the S&P 500 index is up 5.6% this year after a 2017 gain of about 20%.    On Monday, RBC Capital analyst Amit Daryanani, who has an outperform rating, raised his price target to $80 from $77 on the probability that Qualcomm will submit to a higher offer from Broadcom as the March 6 shareholder meeting approaches.

He noted: While we expected management would present its case to investors to remain independent, we are encouraged by the new $1B cost reduction program. We also believe Qualcomm\u2019s acquisition of NXP remains on track and will create a company with significant earnings power and cash flow, developing into a clear industry leader in the mobile, IoT, and automotive semiconductor markets backed by the extremely strong combined IP portfolio of Qualcomm, NXP, and Freescale (Motorola). Susquehanna Financial analyst Christopher Rolland, who has a positive rating and a $78 price target, said it was interesting that Qualcomm management took the announced outlook to note that its auto, Internet of Things, datacenter and other businesses are expected to contribute $7 billion to $8 billion in revenue in fiscal 2019, and that Qualcomm\u2019s 2019 target seems achievable whether it acquires NXP or not.

The world\u2019s most valuable company is expected to report record revenues for its fiscal first quarter on Feb. 1, buoyed by sales of the $1,000 iPhone X. The flagship phone during most of the quarter, but its lofty price should help lift Apple\u2019s top line. Analysts are calling for revenue of $86.8 billion, up 11% from a year ago. The iPhone X starts at $999 for a 64GB model, but survey data indicated that most early adopters willing to pay big bucks for the latest iPhone were springing for the $1,149 model that has four times the storage. As such, analysts predict that the average price of phones sold during the quarter rose to a record of $752, up more than $50 from a year ago, according to FactSet.   The average selling price, or ASP, will also get a boost from the somewhat more reasonably priced iPhone 8 line, which starts at $699 and goes up to $949 for the highest-capacity iPhone 8 Plus, higher prices than the previous year\u2019s new entries in that category. Apple\u2019s December quarter tends to boast the highest average selling prices due to the company\u2019s fall product-launch cycle, as well as interest in buying fancy new models for holiday gifts. Many analysts think the average expectation is too low, though. Mizuho analyst Abhey Lamba said projections for a $50 bump in ASP underestimate the impact of the iPhone X, writing in a note to clients that \u201cexpectations seem very low.\u201d He of $780 to $790, which he thinks could lead to better than expected overall results. Early supply constraints for the iPhone X are likely to keep ASPs in focus looking ahead to the March quarter, with analysts predicting they\u2019ll hit $752 again then. Investors will be looking at Apple\u2019s forecast for the current period as an indication of whether the company expects that sales of the iPhone X were pushed out to early 2018, when supply normalized. Consensus estimates call for sales of $68.1 billion in the current quarter, up 29% from a year ago. Apple shares may trade based on iPhone sales, but analysts will likely use the company\u2019s earnings call as a chance to grill management on other issues as well. Of interest will be the company\u2019s recent admission that it and began a program at the end of the year to offer discounted replacement. Management may provide some insights into the financial and reputational impacts of such moves.   Also noteworthy will be any additional information that Apple chooses to provide about its plans to repatriate cash. The company said in a statement last week that it would build a new campus, create 20,000 jobs, and pay a $38 billion \u201cdeemed repatriation\u201d charge in conjunction with the new tax law. Apple is likely to take that charge on this earnings report, but simply making this payment back to the U.S. CEO Tim Cook said on ABC News recently that the company intends to bring back \u201cthe vast majority\u201d of its cash but didn\u2019t specify an amount or timeline. Management may be pressed to provide more guidance on that during the call.    Analysts on average expect Apple to report adjusted net income of $19.8 billion, up from $17.9 billion a year ago, according to FactSet. The consensus estimate calls for earnings per share of $3.85, compared with $3.36 for the year-ago quarter. Contributors to Estimize, which crowdsources estimates from analysts, fund managers and academics, predict earnings of $3.84 cents a share, on average.  Analysts are calling for revenue of $87.4 billion on average, up from $78.4 billion a year ago. Apple said on its most recent earnings call that it expected revenue of $84 billion to $87 billion for the December quarter. Estimize contributors on average predict revenue of $86.3 billion.  Apple shares are up 38% over the past 12 months through Tuesday\u2019s trading session, though they\u2019ve slipped over the last week on concerns about . The Dow Jones Industrial Average which counts Apple as a component, has gained 31% in that time, while the S&P 500 index has increased 24%. Apple shares have risen following five of the company\u2019s past 10 earnings releases.   iPhone sales remain the most important figure for Apple investors, and commentary about the impact of carrier promotions will be closely watched. Instinet analyst Jeffrey Kvaal notes that wireless companies with the iPhone X this year than they were with other flagship models in the past, adding that carriers had more attractive deals on the iPhone 8. \u201cGiven that the U.S. operators were expecting a healthy promotional quarter even as recently as October, it is possible that Apple may have included a bit more U.S. volume in its planning assumptions for its fiscal first quarter,\u201d he wrote last month. On average, analysts are expecting that Apple sold 79 million iPhones during the quarter, generating $59.7 billion in revenue. The company sold 78 million iPhones a year ago.   The company\u2019s China performance is also crucial, given that last quarter, Apple for the first time in almost two years. Analysts think this is the start of a new pattern, predicting that revenue for Greater China rose 9% during the holiday quarter. Morgan Stanley analyst Katy Huberty sees Apple having \u201caccelerated market share gains for the iPhone in China\u201d recently. Aside from the iPhone segment, Apple\u2019s overall iPad business is , and analysts see that continuing this quarter. They predict $6.1 billion in iPad revenue, up from $5.5 billion during the last holiday quarter. The company has yet to break out Apple Watch sales in its financial results and there\u2019s little reason to believe that the company will finally start doing so this time around. Still, the \u201cOther Products\u201d category that includes Apple Watch as well as iPods, Beats headphones and other accessories, is expected by analysts to grow to $4.6 billion from $4 billion a year ago.   Finally, Apple\u2019s fast-growing services business is of keen interest to Wall Street. This segment includes revenue from the App Store, iCloud, Apple Music, and other non-device elements of Apple\u2019s ecosystem. The company said in early January that in the week beginning on Christmas Eve, \u201ca record number of customers made purchases or downloaded apps from the App Store,\u201d resulting in $890 million in spending over that time. Analysts expect that the services business grew 23%, to $8.7 billion in revenue during the holiday quarter. RBC analyst Amit Daryanani predicts that services growth, along with ASP growth, will help Apple deliver better-than-expected results for the period.

If that sounds familiar, congratulations for paying attention. The big difference this time is that the production-decline rumors are coming a month later than normal for the iPhone X, which should be expected because that new model began selling later than other iPhones. The Nikkei Asian Review wrote Monday that Apple  as it initially expected during the March quarter, and analysts at JP Morgan that the company halved its build orders for the March period relative to the holiday quarter. Both the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal discussed production slowdowns in Tuesday stories.   Apple investors should be familiar with this show. iPhone shipments traditionally peak during the holiday quarter, right after a new model is announced. Then they taper off in the new year as shoppers opt for a greater mix of older models\u2014or figure they can wait around until the next latest and greatest version comes out in the fall. In 2014, after the iPhone 6 produced the so-called supercycle that many expect to repeat with the current crop of Apple smartphones, analysts began chatting about the possibility of a March-quarter production slowdown . A Deutsche Bank analyst wrote at the time that demand for the then-new iPhones might not be as great as the market was predicting and slashed his production estimates for the beginning of 2015 accordingly. The pain was short-lived. Apple shares fell 0.4% on Dec. 2, 2014, the day of that note, after tumbling 3.3% the day earlier after Morgan Stanley analysts suggested paring back Apple allocations. The stock rebounded the next day, slumped again for a month, and then rallied for through the early spring. Share movement following the iPhone 6 and reports of production cuts for that device is notable given that the iPhone 6 is considered to be Apple\u2019s last major design refresh prior to the iPhone X. It was in 2014 that Apple began offering two different screen sizes and made dramatic changes to the phone\u2019s form factor.   Many have expected the iPhone X to drive a similar wave of upgrades. Oppenheimer analyst Andrew Uerkwitz, however, wrote Monday after trimming shipment estimates that \u201cit appears the \u2018supercycle\u2019 we all wanted isn\u2019t here.\u201d He has a perform rating on the stock. It took a bit longer for Apple\u2019s stock to recover during the iPhone 6S cycle, after analysts began rumbling about a production slowdown in December of 2015. An upbeat analyst at Drexel Hamilton that a sampling of supplier stocks had a weaker-than-usual November, but he attributed the performance to timing variations between the different product cycles. Shares were little changed, though they dropped 0.6% on Dec. 14, after . It took shares until October of the following year to rebound to their levels from prior to the Drexel note.   The hubbub began in December 2016 during the iPhone 7 cycle, when Digitimes warned that Apple had started to decrease build orders for the device. Shares dropped 0.9% that day, Dec. 1, before rebounding the next day and beginning a steady rally a week later. For the iPhone X saga, this isn\u2019t even the first report of production pullbacks for Apple, as that it was cutting orders for components. Shares fell 0.9% that day, then jumped 1.7% the next.

Most of the big banks that have just reported fourth-quarter earnings, for example, unveiled multibillion-dollar charges or tax provisions, instead of announcing immediate gains from a lower rate. That\u2019s because the banks have deferred tax assets on their balance sheets, offsets that can be used to reduce future tax liabilities or to defer them. Many big banks suffered multibillion dollar losses during the financial crisis that created tax loss carryforwards that can help reduce their future tax bill. Basically, if you lose enough money one year, you can spread out the deduction of those losses over multiple years. Deferred tax assets can also be created when tax authorities recognize revenue or costs at different times than that of an accounting standard. Deferred tax assets are worth less when the tax rate is changed, in this case lowered from 35% to 21%, a 40% cut. That caused  which has the largest deferred tax assets of any U.S. company, to announce a $22 billion non-cash charge for the fourth quarter that completely wiped out its profit.    On the company\u2019s earnings call, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach spoke glowingly of the new tax law, which he said will help the economy and the bank and its clients over time. Other companies that have to disclose the loss in value of these credits now include  American International Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp.  .        On the other end of the spectrum are those companies that have deferred tax liabilities on their balance sheets, meaning they are facing an increase in taxes payable in the future. Those companies are enjoying a nice windfall now along with lower taxes going forward. Deferred tax liabilities are formed when the real tax payment according to tax accounting is lower than the tax obligation based on financial accounting, as can happen with depreciating fixed assets.    was the only big bank to see its fourth-quarter profit get a boost from writing down its deferred tax liabilities to reflect the new tax rate. The bank said its income of $6.15 billion, or $1.16 a share, benefited from a $3.35 billion one-time tax boost. Excluding that benefit, and other one-time items including the sale of an insurance unit and legal reserves, the bank had EPS of 97 cents.    As earnings season kicks into high gear next week, investors can expect all companies to offer an update on how the tax law will impact their business. But companies that don\u2019t use Dec. 31 as their year end will have to wait until fiscal 2019 to enjoy the full impact. That\u2019s because they will have to use a blended old and new rate to calculate their taxable income.       Microsoft Corp. for example, has a fiscal year ended June 30. That means it will have a blended rate of 28%, based on six months at 35% and six months at 21%. The Securities and Exchange Commission has already issued guidance on how companies should reflect the impact of the lower tax rates and other changes in their next filings. Companies are expected to take charges or record benefits based on a reasonable estimate, although that might be adjusted later. The SEC told companies that additional disclosures should accompany the announcement of any charges or credits, including any explanations for why the numbers might not yet be final.    Although the impact of tax cuts may reduce overall net earnings for the fourth quarter, it could lead many companies to raise, or give upbeat earnings guidance for 2018. In the weeks following passage of the tax bill, the average estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet for S&P 500 earnings per share increased 2.2% to $150.12 from $146.83, the largest increase during that time frame\u2014Dec. 20 through Jan. 11\u2014since FactSet began tracking earnings data in 1996.    But more importantly, the one-time mandatory repatriation tax on cash held overseas, which will be levied whether the cash is repatriated or not, could actually help line investors pockets down the road, in more ways than one. The idea is that if companies have to pay taxes on that money anyway, then they might as well bring it home. The repatriation tax will levy 15.5% of a company\u2019s liquid overseas funds and 8% of its illiquid assets. The tax can be paid over eight years and aims to encourage companies with big cashpiles to bring it back and invest in the U.S. Some companies, like Apple Inc.  , have indicated they will bring a big chunk of the cash held overseas back to the U.S. As BTIG analyst Walter Piecyk said, announcements, like Apple\u2019s, make for \u201cgood politics,\u201d but are usually short on details. In Apple\u2019s case, Piecyk said he was directed to the upcoming 10-Q quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is expected in early February.  : . Analyst Amit Daryanani at RBC Capital said he expects Apple will use \u201calmost all\u201d of the money it brings home for share repurchases and dividend payments to shareholders, instead of the capital investments that could accelerate job growth. He said the $30 billion Apple said it would spend on capital expenditures over the next five years was mostly built into previously provided capex guidance for 2018. While Main Street may be left disappointed, Wall Street will likely rejoice. Increasing dividends, or paying a special one-time dividend, puts cash directly into investors\u2019 pockets, while share repurchases provide a couple of indirect benefits. First, buybacks introduce demand to the marketplace, which helps sop up trading supply. Although actively buying a stock doesn\u2019t guarantee the price will rise, at the very least it can reduce the negative effect of selling. More importantly, buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding, which means the piece of each investor\u2019s pie gets a little bigger\u2014it\u2019s just math. Using Apple again as an example, the company said net income for the quarter through Sept. 30\u2014the numerator\u2014increased 18.9% from a year ago to $10.71 billion, but EPS increased 24.0% to $2.07 as the number of shares used in calculation\u2014the denominator\u2014declined 3.9% to 5.18 billion shares. Even before the tax bill was passed, companies had stepped up their buyback announcements and a lot more are likely on the way. \u201cI expect a lot more announcements of rewards for shareholders,\u201d William Lazonick, professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts Lowell and director of the Center for Industrial Competitiveness, told MarketWatch in December.  : .
