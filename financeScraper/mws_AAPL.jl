Given the HomePod\u2019s $349 price, that $216 cost suggests Apple is generating margins of about 38 percent, according to the product analysis firm. That compares with margins of 66 percent and 56 percent for the Google Home and Amazon Echo, products that compete in the smart-speaker market, but offer lower audio quality, according to the firm\u2019s estimates. \u201cApple is compressing their margins a bit, wanting to go big or go home,\u201d said Al Cowsky, TechInsight\u2019s costing manager. \u201cIn doing so, I suspect they reduced the selling price from a normal Apple margin in order to sell more units on volume.\u201d For comparison, the Cupertino, California-based company generates margins of 64 percent on the flagship iPhone X, according to a materials teardown by IHS Markit. A $349 original Apple Watch from 2015 was estimated by IHS to cost only $84 for the materials. Apple\u2019s latest hardware product has won praise for its sound quality but criticism for the lack of smooth integration with the Siri digital voice assistant and the inability to work tightly with some popular outside applications, unlike its rivals. Apple, like Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, wants the HomePod to keep consumers tied to its system of services like its music subscription. The bulk of the HomePod\u2019s costs come from the internal speaker technology, including the many microphones, tweeters, the woofer and the power management components. That adds up to $58, while an additional $60 includes various smaller parts like the lighting system used to display the Siri animation on the top of the device. The HomePod\u2019s A8 chip is estimated to cost $25.50, while the external housing and other items come in at $25. TechInsights also estimates manufacturing, testing, and packaging to add up to $17.50. Apple didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment on the HomePod materials analysis. Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook commented on component breakdowns in 2015 during an earnings call by stating he has \u201cnever seen one that is anywhere close to being accurate.\u201d", "author": "By ", "headline": "Apple's HomePod Speaker Costs $216 to Build, TechInsights Says - Bloomberg", "source": "https://www.bloomberg.com/", "tick": "AAPL"}

An EMagin filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission\u00a0listing Apple among \"specified investors\" was reported earlier on Monday by TechCrunch, Bloomberg News and others. The document, from Jan. 23, proposed an EMagin share offering and also named LG Display Co., virtual-reality startup Immerex, gaming company Valve Corp., and Stillwater Holdings LLC as investors. Lucas said EMagin listed those companies in the filing because it had discussions with them at industry events. If those firms had decided to invest, EMagin would have given them different pricing. However, that didn\u2019t happen, at least in Apple\u2019s case, he said in an interview. The filing was misinterpreted, the CFO added. An Apple spokesman declined to comment. Shares of EMagin jumped as much as 41 percent earlier on Monday. After Bloomberg reported Lucas\u2019 comments, the stock gave up a lot of those gains and was temporarily halted.

{"link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2018-02-13/apple-stock-watchers-lose-some-of-that-loving-feeling", "text": "Wall Street is having second thoughts about Apple Inc., and that should worry the company's shareholders. Among the stock analysts who track Apple, about two-thirds now say the company's shares are worth buying, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That seems like a large share, but it's relatively pessimistic in the grade inflation-prone world of Wall Street stock recommendations. It is the lowest percentage of buy ratings for Apple in nearly three years, Bloomberg data show. The last time Apple stock watchers were this (relatively) discouraged, Apple shares essentially treaded water for the next two years. The recent past is not necessarily predictive of what happens next,\u00a0but it also can't be encouraging to Apple optimists. Allow me to turn back the clock to that prior Wall Street patch of Apple pessimism from\u00a0April 2015. The company had recently released what turned out to be a blockbuster iPhone model, the first larger-screen Apple smartphone that investors and mobile phone shoppers had been anticipating for years. Just as Apple's revenue was jumping thanks to those iPhone 6 models, analysts in aggregate worried that Apple might have peaked. In April 2015, just before Apple posted quarterly earnings that sparked a about the company's prospects,\u00a0the share of analysts who said Apple stock was worth buying shifted to a low of 65 percent. In hindsight, the stock watchers' relative bearishness was a good barometer. Apple's share price hit a record closing high of $133 in February 2015, fell as much as 32 percent within 15 months, and then took until early 2017 to crawl back to that February 2015 high. Apple stockholders who held on after Wall Street's peak pessimism had little to show for a two-year roller-coaster ride. Apple history may not be repeating itself, but it is rhyming. As in the last low-water mark for Apple buy ratings in 2015, the company recently released a radically redesigned iPhone model that investors and mobile phone shoppers had been anticipating for years. Just as in 2015, Wall Street's enthusiasm had been building for more than a year and then soured a tad after the much-anticipated new iPhone model went from rumor to reality. And as usual, the key issue for Wall Street is whether Apple's best days are ahead or in the rear-view mirror. Analysts spent the last year or more convincing themselves that Apple was about to hit a new vein of iPhone growth thanks to the iPhone X model. Analysts' . They still think that Apple's sales and profits will grow robustly for a company of its size, but the expected sources of growth have changed. Wall Street estimates no longer consistently forecast Apple to sell more iPhones this year than it did in the golden year of iPhone 6 sales. Instead, analysts think that higher iPhone prices combined with plumper sales of ancillary Apple products, apps and internet add-ons will be the main sources of growth in the coming year or more. Hopes are still high for Apple, but there has been a collective rethinking in the investment world of the kind of company Apple is becoming. The large minority of stock analysts who believed Apple had peaked in early 2015 were correct -- at least for a while. Apple stock watchers are , but it's still unwise to ignore when their collective feelings about Apple turn pessimistic.

Cook was asked if shareholders would receive a special dividend this year as part of Apple bringing hundreds of billions of dollars in cash back to the U.S. The CEO said he\u2019s \"not a fan\" of special dividends but said the company\u2019s board remains \"committed\" to annual dividend increases. Directors will discuss the issue in April, as in previous years, he noted at the meeting inside the company\u2019s new Steve Jobs Theater, in Cupertino, California. Cook also made some of his most explicit comments on succession planning, saying that one of his most important roles as CEO is properly \"passing the baton\" to a new leader. Every Apple board meeting in recent years has had succession planning on the agenda for all key executive roles, he said. The comments were prompted by a question on Cook\u2019s succession and that of Jony Ive, the company\u2019s chief design officer. Cook, 57, was named CEO in 2011, succeeding Jobs. Ive returned to his management role in December. The CEO was also quizzed on the mobile payments industry. While Apple Pay has an \"extraordinary future ahead of it,\" the acceptance of mobile payments has taken off slower than he expected, Cook said. Still, there\u2019s been rapid adoption over the past year in Japan, China and Russia, he added.

{"link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-13/apple-executive-bench-is-deep-as-ceo-succession-question-raised", "text": ". Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook addressed succession at the company\u2019s annual shareholder meeting on Tuesday, saying that eventually \"passing the baton\" properly is one of his most important roles. The company has a deep bench of experienced managers who could fill Cook\u2019s shoes when the time comes. Apple\u2019s leadership team includes 10 executives other than Cook and features veterans like operations chief Jeff Williams, services head Eddy Cue, product marketing boss Phil Schiller, and hardware leader Dan Riccio. There are also relative newcomers, like Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri and retail head Angela Ahrendts, who brought leadership experience from other companies. At the meeting in Cupertino, California, Cook said every Apple board meeting in recent years has had succession planning on the agenda for all key executive roles, but he didn\u2019t specify any potential successors. Cook, 57, has been CEO since succeeding Steve Jobs in 2011. He\u2019s led an explosion in revenue and profit, while\u00a0expanding services like music streaming and overseeing the launch of the Apple Watch, iPhone X and HomePod. There\u2019s no reason to believe Cook is planning to step down any time soon. And\u00a0given how far off his departure may be, it\u2019s possible a successor isn\u2019t even on the executive team yet. But Cook\u2019s comments marked a new level of specificity on the topic. Apple declined to comment beyond the CEO\u2019s remarks. Williams, Apple\u2019s chief operating officer, would probably be Cook\u2019s most likely successor if the CEO were to step down in the immediate future. Williams, who like Cook is an operations maestro, manages the company\u2019s global supply chain, which churns out the iPhones, iPads, and Macs that generate the majority of Apple\u2019s revenue. He\u2019s also taken on a more public profile in recent years by managing the Apple Watch\u2019s development and announcing new health features at press conferences. Ahrendts, who came to Apple in 2014 to run its retail division, was formerly the CEO of Burberry Group Plc where she engineered a turnaround of the luxury goods maker. She has been discussed as a potential successor to Cook because of her experience and ability to connect with employees and customers. \"Fake news, fake news, silly, no,\" Ahrendts said to BuzzFeed News when asked about succession last year. Still, she would instantly become one of the most powerful women in the business world as the leader of the most-valuable public company. Apple is trying to increase diversity, and naming Ahrendts as CEO would shake up a technology industry criticized for its male-dominated culture. Another possibility would be Craig Federighi, Apple\u2019s top software executive. He oversees the software running on iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Siri, and has quickly become one of the most public facing and important leaders at the company. He has the ear of Apple developers and runs a complex organization of thousands of software engineers working on future iPhone features. \"I see my role as CEO to prepare as many people as I can to be CEO and that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing and then the board makes a decision at that point in time,\" Cook said in the same BuzzFeed interview as Ahrendts. At the shareholder meeting on Tuesday, Cook was also asked about the eventual succession of\u00a0Chief Design Officer Jony Ive. Cook didn\u2019t comment on specific executives. In 2015, Ive shifted management responsibilities to a pair of design vice presidents, Alan Dye and Richard Howarth, while he focused on the design of the company\u2019s new Apple Park campus.

His conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., reported that it cut its stake in Big Blue by 94 percent during the fourth quarter, essentially drawing to a close a rare blemish on his investing record. The move was disclosed in a regulatory filing Wednesday that also showed Omaha, Nebraska-based Berkshire increased its investment in Apple Inc., now valued at nearly $28 billion. And it initiated a new holding in Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., worth about $365 million, in the final three months of last year. IBM was always a curiosity for Buffett followers. He\u2019d spent years telling them that technology companies were outside his area of expertise then plowed more than $10 billion into the company in 2011. Back then, Buffett\u2019s investment was a huge vote of confidence for the aging computer-services firm and its leadership. But things soon went south. IBM struggled with declining sales, forcing Buffett to defend the pick. For awhile, he even added some to his holdings. Last year, however, he\u2019d had enough. Just before Berkshire\u2019s annual meeting in May, he acknowledged that his valuation had been flawed and that he\u2019d begun to on the investment. Buffett had hinted he might sell additional IBM shares before the end of last year. Since some of the stock traded below his purchase price, it would have been for Berkshire to recognize a loss when tax rates were higher, he said this January. Berkshire\u2019s stake in the company stood at just 2 million shares at the end of December, which have a market value of about $309 million. The episode has highlighted just how badly Buffett opportunities in tech companies that have come to dominate the ranks of the world\u2019s most valuable enterprises. At the annual meeting, he issued a mea culpa, adding that he \u201cblew it\u201d by failing to invest early in Google despite having plenty of chances to learn about and understand its business model. In a sign of his new thinking, Buffett plowed billions of dollars into Apple starting in 2016. He added more to that investment in the fourth quarter, boosting Berkshire\u2019s total stake in the iPhone maker by 23 percent to about 165 million shares. While much smaller, Berkshire\u2019s new investment in Teva may capture investor attention. The drugmaker has lost more than two-thirds of its value in the last two years.

To clean up some of the company\u2019s more than $30 billion in debt, Schultz said he\u2019ll cut about at the company -- a step that past CEOs have been unwilling to take given Teva\u2019s close ties to its home market in Israel. He\u2019s also the drugmaker\u2019s management, and said it will eliminate some money-losing products.

I went upstairs to change and, from my room I heard him let out a shout, followed by a crash,\u201d . \u201cI\u2019ll be able to rescue things from my hard drive, but the screen is f***ed and there has definitely been a significant amount of water damage. I\u2019ll have to replace it.\u201d He offered to replace it \u2014 with anything but Apple. And it\u2019s not because of the price, which start at . His option, which she didn\u2019t specify, was just as expensive. \u201cI told him, \u2018Thank you, but no thank you,\u2019\u201d she added. \u201cI can take advantage of a payment plan through Apple. I have excellent credit and no debts other than some low-balance student loans.\u201d \u201cThis was when he started getting over-the-top annoyed about it,\u201d she said. \u201cBemoaning how I would rather \u2018go into debt\u2019 than let him help me, asking why I wouldn\u2019t finally switch away from an Apple device now that \u2018fate stepped in.\u2019 It\u2019s been a few days, and he won\u2019t get off my case about it even though I\u2019m the one who lost a rather expensive computer that meant a lot to me.\u201d      Reddit commenters were, for the most part, on her side. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be an alarmist, but my abusive ex-husband did something very similar,\u201d one woman wrote. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t long before he was telling me what I could and couldn\u2019t wear, how my hair could be cut, and what I was allowed to eat. This is controlling behavior.\u201d Another of the 500 comments said it was a \u201cdefinite red flag.\u201d It may sound crazy, but studies suggest people judge others by their choice of gadget and believe it reflects their values. iPhone owners are 21 times more likely to judge others negatively for having an Android, while those who have an Android are 15 times more likely to judge others negatively for having an iPhone, a by dating site Match.com found. And those who have older models of either smartphone are 56% less likely to get a date. : iPhone users earn higher incomes than Android users, according to research group ComScore. \u201cWe look for so many other ways in which we\u2019re compatible with potential partners, why shouldn\u2019t phones be on the list?\u201d says Abby Rodman, a psychotherapist in Boston. But some people have found working conditions in Apple factories in China enough to say \u2018no\u2019 to the iPhone. A 2014 BBC \u201c \u201d documentary found falling asleep on the iPhone production line, after putting in shifts of up to 18 hours. At the time, Apple said, \u201cWe are aware of no other company doing as much as Apple to ensure fair and safe working conditions.\u201d That\u2019s unlikely to help the Apple standoff in that couple\u2019s relationship. One possible solution before Valentine\u2019s night: Give her the money and allow her to buy whatever brand she chooses.

They\u2019re the ones on the sidelines making a few basis points a year from a savings account. What might get them to change their minds? One thing we know for certain is that prices for many stocks are considerably lower than they were when two benchmark indexes hit their all-time closing highs last month. At the end of trading Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 Index were each down 8% from record closing highs Jan. 26. For some investors, the right \u201centry point\u201d kept slipping further away as the market rose, almost endlessly, since the bull market began about nine years ago. Failing to invest in stocks almost guarantees a smaller nest egg. Maybe it\u2019s time for those on the sidelines to consider making small, but frequent, investments in the stock market.    If you had done so three years ago, you would have gone through some periods of difficulty. But, as you can see on this chart, periods of falling stock prices were actually opportunities. Your small, regular investments would have been purchased at cheaper prices, setting up even bigger gains when the market eventually recovered: In his , Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett said \u201cthe years ahead will occasionally deliver major market declines \u2014 even panics \u2014 that will affect virtually all stocks.\u201d He also said neither he nor anyone else could predict when panics would take place. Buffett added: \u201cDuring such scary periods, you should never forget two things: First, widespread fear is your as an investor, because it serves up bargain purchases. Second, fear is your enemy.\u201d The italics are his. We cannot say what the stock market will do during any given period. But we know for certain that 29 of the 30 Dow stocks were cheaper at the close Feb. 12 compared with the close Jan. 26: You can click on the tickers for more information about each company, including price ratios, news and financials. Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. were the worst performers in the Dow from Jan. 26 through Feb. 12, as the price of West Texas crude oil declined 10%. On Aug. 23, I published an article saying that might have been the perfect time to buy shares of Exxon Mobil and Chevron. Since then, even with the recent decline, the price of oil has risen 18%, while shares of Exxon Mobil have pulled back slightly and Chevron\u2019s stock has risen 7%. Surely aren\u2019t enough to put the brakes on the positive supply-demand outlook for oil or the growth of the U.S. economy, for that matter. These S&P 500 stocks, most of them widely held in mutual funds and hedge funds, were down at least 15% from Jan. 26 through Feb. 12: Philip van Doorn covers various investment and industry topics.

In addition to a visual overlay, AR may also provide audio and tactile inputs to the user, and rely upon presence and positioning technologies to present location-specific sensory inputs and information to the user. In this manner, AR represents a blending of information technology and media within a real-world environment for the benefit of consumer, business, and industrial users.    Download the full report:     The term Mixed Reality (MR) pertains to a form of hybrid reality in which physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real-time. With MR, either virtual objects are digitally mixed into reality or real-world objects are merged into virtual worlds. The latter case is sometimes referred to as Augmented Virtuality (AV), and is one step closer to Virtual Reality (VR), as real-world objects in a virtual world take on a sense of permanency with real objects, appearing to actually exist within the virtual world.  Adding to this sense of permanency, real-world objects in a virtual world may be digitally controlled. Conversely, MR may also support manipulation of virtual objects permanently placed in the real-world. In either scenario, MR will be an important aspect of teleoperation and tele-robotics.  The primary goal of AR is to enrich the user's perception of the real-world, providing information and insights that otherwise would not be obtainable. AR use cases have grown substantially across many industry verticals within the last two years, providing significant market momentum, and indicating great promise to transform communications, content, and commerce across a wide range of sectors. The goals of MR are broad, yet directionally focused on a true merging of real and virtual worlds, which Mind Commerce believes will be a major catalyst for wide-spread acceptance and usage of VR across all major industry sectors.  This research assesses AR, MR, and other immersive technology components, the AR/MR ecosystem, and competitive landscape. The report evaluates market opportunities for hardware, software, and services. Analysis takes into consideration market drivers and constraints such as potential regulatory implications.

{"link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/warren-buffett-and-berkshire-hathaway-reveal-top-stocks-for-2018-2018-02-14", "text": "Published: By Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-A) has released its public equity holdings as of December 31, 2017. As Warren Buffett still runs Berkshire Hathaway and as he is one of the richest men alive, Buffett is also considered to be one of the greatest investors of the modern era. Maybe that means his stock picks and the stock picks of those working under him may be interesting to outside investors as well. 24/7 Wall St. has tracked many of the so-called \"whale watching\" trades made by America's top investment managers, hedge fund managers, and independent investors. There almost seems to be no greater endorsement in all whale-watching activities than to have a new stake held by Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway. What matters about the holdings of Buffett at the end of each year is that some investors consider this the top picks of Warren Buffett for the year ahead. The Berkshire Hathaway quarterly SEC filing (13F), which often varies from each quarterly earnings filing, showed the balance as of December 31 as being $191.2 billion in from a total of 14 entities. In Berkshire Hathaway's third quarter earnings report, without having the fourth quarter earnings yet, the entire base of all assets among all entities was $681.5 billion and the fair value of all equity securities was listed as $157.65 billion. A quarter ago, that figure of equity securities was listed as having more than $82.2 billion in unrealized gains. For reference on the 13F listed amount, the S&amp;P 500 was last seen up 7.6% from the end of September of 2017 - and that was with the stock market still down about 6% from the all-time highs hit in January of 2018. As an additional reminder, Buffett's changes that took place before the end of the fourth quarter were made on average at least one or two months before the recent market volatility rattled investors. And Buffett has already signaled that Berkshire Hathaway has been buying and selling, but he was all in all a net buyer of stocks. He also said he would have chosen a different method of tax reform, but corporate tax reform would be good for the parent Berkshire Hathaway company, its subsidiaries, and would be good for almost all of the companies he invests in. Investors should keep in mind that Warren Buffett and his team of portfolio managers have made some major changes to their stock holdings over the years. Berkshire Hathaway's stock holdings are quite different\u00a0from 10 years ago and significantly different from 20 years ago. We looked at the end of the 2007 annual earnings report, and the market value of all of Buffett's stocks was $75 billion (with a cost basis of $39.25 billion). The addition of two more portfolio managers in recent years has only made the changes look even more extreme over time. 24/7 Wall St. has highlighted the top holdings of Warren Buffett and we have covered some of the select shares which were added as new positions, which positions were added to, which positions were deleted, and which positions saw some selling but where Berkshire still holds a stake. American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) was the same 151.6 million shares as it has been for years. This remains a top holding of Buffett for decades now. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) was listed as a big increase of 31.2 million shares to a stake of more than 165.33 million shares. That stake had been raised the prior quarter by 3.9 million shares. If you look at the IBM stake, Apple was the likely substitute for a \"Buffett tech exposure\" trade. Bank of America Corp.

Buffett sold almost 35 million shares during the fourth quarter of 2017, and the old 37.03 million shares at the end of the third quarter went down to just 2.048 million shares at the end of December of 2017. Kraft Heinz Co. (NASDAQ: KHC) is also a continued massive holding that is outside of the normal book-keeping in the largest stock holdings. Berkshire Hathaway currently holds 325.634 million shares of Kraft Heinz. The large stake in Phillips 66 (NYSE: PSX) simply does not matter at this point as far as what was said in the 13F Filing. It has just been released in the last day that Buffett sold off a $3+ billion stake to get back under the 10% effective ownership regulatory hurdle. Wells Fargo &amp; Co.

The publication deemed the HomePod\u2019s audio quality strong , but it of the Sonos One and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google Home Max.

{"link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-know-when-us-stocks-will-bottom-according-to-eight-investing-pros-2018-02-12", "text": "Published: Bottom line: It may be too early to give the all-clear By Relax, it\u2019s not the end of the world. It\u2019s a spate of wicked market volatility \u2014 which might not be over. That\u2019s because it was caused by funds getting into trouble with leveraged bets against volatility. When volatility spiked on signs of rising inflation, they were forced to sell. Now, investors worry there are more time bombs out there, and that they might take out a bank and damage the financial system. A look at the credit markets suggest these fears are probably overblown \u2014 at least so far. The yield spread between U.S. corporate bonds and safer Treasurys has widened a bit. But it is still tight. \u201cThe credit market is not flashing warning signs,\u201d says Colin McWey of Heartland Select Value Fund  Nevertheless, given the uncertainties, you can expect continued nervousness \u2014 and selling. What to do now? If you joined the crowd and bought stocks in January and you\u2019re underwater, probably the best thing to do is ride it out. If you have cash on the sidelines, there\u2019s a buying opportunity in here somewhere. But where? I recently spoke with several market veterans to round up their favorite signs that the market has bottomed. Here are seven signs of a market bottom to look for now.      Nuveen Asset Management chief equity strategist Bob Doll wants to see lower selling intensity as the market retests lows. He gauges this by watching for fewer names popping up on the 52-week low list, fewer declines for the day and lower volume \u2014 as retests proceed. So far, there\u2019s a glimmer of hope here. \u201cWe made a new low with less intensity, and that\u2019s always key,\u201d says Doll, referring to the selling last Thursday (Feb. 8). But it may be too early to give the all-clear. \u201cWe might have to try to retest and go another couple of weeks with volatility,\u201d says Louis Navellier of Navellier & Associates, who also likes to see volume dry up on retests as a sign of the low. \u201cIt would help if somebody from the Fed said something just to calm everybody down.\u201d Bruce Bittles, the chief investment strategist at Robert W. Baird, looks for the following signal that downside momentum has been broken. He wants to see two days where upside volume on the New York Stock Exchange exceeds downside volume by ratio of 10 to 1 or more. (It doesn\u2019t have to be two consecutive days.) \u201cThat would tell me it\u2019s safe to go in the water. You need to see the downside momentum broken,\u201d says Bittles. \u201cOtherwise you get a rally and you can\u2019t trust the rally.\u201d   Leuthold Group chief investment strategist Jim Paulsen likes to see a definitive flight to safety to signal the capitulation and panic that typically marks a bottom. To him, this shows up as a rush into Treasury bonds, the dollar, gold and defensive stocks like utilities and consumer staples. Bad news here for bulls. So far, nada. Treasury bonds haven\u2019t spiked. The U.S. dollar index has only risen slightly. Gold and the VanEck Vectors Gold Miners exchange traded fund have actually declined during the current market collapse. And utilities and consumer staples have not rallied. \u201cI still don\u2019t see a capitulation panic in either the market action or in media and strategist comments,\u201d says Paulsen. \u201cMy guess is we retest recent lows again before this correction is over.\u201d But that is only a guess, he points out. \u201cI sense a lot of discomfort, but I don\u2019t sense the fear yet,\u201d agrees Bittles at Robert W. Baird. \u201cI\u2019d like to see the FAANG stocks take a big hit,\u201d he says, referring to Facebook Amazon.com Apple Netflix and Alphabet  \u201cI think that could also be climactic.\u201d He thinks a move to 21,500 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average would cause enough fear to mark a bottom because that is slightly below the 200-day moving average.   The end of a selling phase is often punctuated by a big move down at the open on big volume followed by a quick rebound and then relative calm. This is a sign of the final flush to watch out for.   I was telling subscribers to my stock letter, , in December and January to be careful about the market, close dubious trades, raise buying power and avoid owning stocks on margin. The reason: Sentiment was off-the-charts bullish, which is bearish in the contrarian sense. By the same token, now that the market has tanked, we\u2019ll know it\u2019s a safer time to buy when sentiment declines sharply and there\u2019s more fear. One good measure to watch is the Investors Intelligence Bull/Bear ratio. Look for moves below 2, and especially below 1, to mark a buyable bearish extreme. Mid-week, last week, it was at 3.51. So it has a ways to go. Also keep an eye on the media for heightened negativity. Recently, comparisons of the current selloff to the 2008 meltdown is a start. This is an encouraging contrarian signal. (And, no, this is not a 2008 repeat.) Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer of The Leuthold Group, wants to see a spike above 0.85 in the three-day equity put/call ratio tracked by the Chicago Board Options Exchange. That indicates heightened interest in put buying, a defensive maneuver, related to calls, which are typically bought by optimists. So far, this ratio has not hit that level. \u201cI am surprised and troubled that this indicator hasn\u2019t shot up more,\u201d says Ramsey. \u201cWe are looking for lower lows over the next two weeks.\u201d   Lawrence McDonald of the watches the prices investors pay for CBOE Volatility Index futures across time, or the VIX futures curve. If they\u2019re paying up a lot for the near-term contract (February expiration) compared with contracts that expire eight months out, it\u2019s a sign of peak fear. And that\u2019s what he sees now, which means a relief rally may be at hand. Investors are paying 12 times as much for February contracts compared with the September contract. For context, during the \u201cGrexit\u201d crisis in 2011 (when investors worried that Greece would leave the European Union) this multiple was 10.4. And when the markets cratered in early 2016, the multiple was 5.1. \u201cBuying the front month is like burning up cash because it expires soon. So when people are paying up for the front month, it is a sign of desperation,\u201d says McDonald. \u201cIt means we are close to the bottom. We will probably have a good tradable bounce here.\u201d McDonald expects more market downside later this year as inflation heats up. He thinks rising inflation will compound investor losses by hitting both stocks and bonds. This could lead to more selling by panicked investors who are unused to seeing both stocks and bonds get hit at the same time. So it could get ugly.   Some investors pick a reasonable valuation for the overall market, and wait for the market to hit that level to consider buying. For Will Riley, who helps manage the Guinness Atkinson Global Energy Fund that\u2019s a forward price-to-earnings ratio on the S&P 500 Index of 16 times. It will have to fall to 2,450 to get there. \u201cObviously the market can overshoot that, but that\u2019s where we\u2019d be looking to start deploying capital,\u201d he says.   An old standby to mark near-term lows is a technical indicator called the Trading Index (TRIN). To derive it, take the number of advancing issues divided by the number of declining issues. Then divide that by the advancing volume divided by declining volume. When the TRIN denominator shrinks because declining volume is extreme relative to advancing volume, the TRIN ratio goes up. This signals extreme bearishness. The key takeaway on how to read this gauge: Two trading days with a TRIN above 2 is a buy signal, says Bittles at Robert W. Baird. They do not have to be consecutive days.   Michael Brush is a Manhattan-based financial writer who publishes the stock newsletter .

Starting Tuesday, publishers will be able to try out a developer preview of AMP stories, which feature swipeable slides of text, photos, graphics and videos, Google announced in a blog post. Publishers including Vox Media, Cond\u00e9 Nast, Meredith Corp. and Time Warner Inc.\u2019s CNN were involved in the early development of the technology and have already begun creating such stories for the mobile web. AMP stories are reminiscent of the immersive, vertical stories pioneered by Snap Inc.\u2019s Snapchat, which spurred copycat features from social-media rivals. In 2016, Facebook Inc.\u2019s Instagram launched Instagram Stories, a swipeable product that has also gained traction among many publishers. With publishers eager to make money from the rising tide of consumers viewing content on mobile devices, tech companies also have introduced products designed to aggregate news and speed the loading of articles on mobile, including Apple Inc.\u2019s Apple News app and Facebook\u2019s Instant Articles. Unlike those products, however, AMP stories doesn\u2019t yet allow advertising to be incorporated. Google is in the process of building support for ads but didn\u2019t disclose a time frame.

Higher wages are raising the specter of inflation. As a result, interest rates have risen rapidly as investors and traders anticipate that the era of benign inflation may be coming to an end. Does it make sense to wait until the next inflation-related data point is released before making big buy or sell decisions in the markets? If yes, please read on. The Morning Capsule that is made available to the subscribers to The Arora Report every day before the market open said: \u201cFrom a fundamental perspective, the reason for the downdraft is the specter of inflation. On Wednesday morning at 8:30 a.m. ET, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be released. The smart money appears to be waiting for this data before acting.\u201d So the all-important inflation report coincides with Valentine\u2019s Day this year. May both events be favorable to investors ... Let\u2019s examine inflation using a chart.      Please click to see the chart of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) excluding food and energy prices. Please note the following from the chart: \u2022 The specter of deflation is over. \u2022 CPI ex-food and energy can vary quite a bit from month to month. \u2022 The Federal Reserve has been targeting 2% inflation. The data so far are not out of line.    The consensus is for CPI to come in at 0.4%. Expect machine-driven investing strategies to buy stocks if that number is lower and sell if the number is higher. However, most investors should not react to what machines may do when the news hits. At The Arora Report we look at CPI ex-food and energy; our estimate is 0.2%. Yes, we all consume food and energy. The reason for excluding food and energy is that food and energy are volatile. The volatility makes it impossible to use the data for any kind of prediction.

Of course, when the market went down last week, techs didn\u2019t exactly escape. This comes after investors yanked around $4 billion from the PowerShares QQQ Trust ETF last week, the most since the dot-com bubble burst, Guenthner notes, citing Bloomberg data. \u201cThe herd clearly believes that the strongest stocks on the market will be the ones that have the farthest to fall if market weakness persists. But we\u2019re not so sure about that \u2026 ,\u201d said Guenthner. Larry Tentarelli, of the , attests further to tech strength.

The designer business Badgley Mischka, which has been going strong for three decades, is renown for its beaded gowns and was recently saluted by for catering to clientele who hark back to \u201cwhen being a part of high society\u2014or dressing like you were\u2014was a much more important mark of status than the number of Instagram followers you have.\u201d Yet in what marked the first initiative of its kind in the fashion business, attendees at their fall 2018 show at New York Fashion Week were encouraged to download an app, powered by global software provider SAP that rated the look of each Badgley Mischka outfit appearing on the runway in front of them. The app, via the aid of beacon technology, quizzed users on whether they \u201cliked\u201d or \u201cloved\u201d each look they saw and supplied information on each garment. 179 users from 17 different countries cast 1,396 votes on Badgley Mischka clothes during the 15-minute show. Badgley and Mischka were watching the interactive feedback on an iPad while the show was in progress. Afterward, the information went public for users who weren\u2019t in the room. \u201cI was surprised by the results which makes it even more fascinating,\u201d Mark Badgley told MarketWatch. The outfit that received the most \u201clove\u201d votes was a crimson ballgown. A short black dress also proved popular. \u201cI\u2019m probably the lowest tech guy you could ever meet in your entire life,\u201d Badgley said, \u201cbut for all the millennials out there and the way the world\u2019s changing, I find it amusing that probably the most classic old school type of ballgown still reigns supreme.\u201d He added: \u201cIt just goes to show you that some things are true and everlasting. I love the fact that that ball gown was everyone\u2019s favorite because it\u2019s very true to our brand. It didn\u2019t have to be some crazy avant-garde piece that came out of the runway that was the favorite.\u201d \u201cPeople who were at the show are the decision-makers in the fashion industry \u2014 the buyers, the press, the bloggers,\u201d said James Mischka. \u201c[They are] the people who really do have a voice. We get to hear from them right now, what they think, instead of waiting for six months from now when we get the final feedback from the retailers.\u201d For the designers, this went beyond attempting to increase its credibility with a younger crowd. The instantaneous response on what proved popular will enable the company to manage its inventory better, operate faster and make its fall collection more cost-efficient. \u201cThe information we\u2019re getting from it is for our sales and production team,\u201d said Mischka. \u201cWe\u2019re still going to design what we want to design and we obviously listen to our clients and our market but at the same time this is going to streamline the sales process and the production process for our company.\u201d Lori Mitchell-Keller, global general manager for consumer industries at SAP, said the partnership has its origins in her company\u2019s software user collaboration with Apple . \u201cWhat brought us to Badgley Mischka was that they were also trying to figure out how they get products to consumers faster than they\u2019ve been able to do and how to integrate more technology into their business,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re really trying to appeal at a price point that\u2019s a little bit lower than some of the couture fashion houses so it attracts some of the younger buyers who want to interact with technology.\u201d Badgley Mischka\u2019s tech initiative comes as social media platforms have revolutionized fashion and the \u201cSee Now, Buy Now\u201d model that, for the last two years, has disrupted the traditional six-month wait between the runway and when the clothes arrive in stores. Coco Rocha, the Canadian model who has sometimes been referred to as the world\u2019s first digital supermodel for her pioneering use of tech platforms, joined Badgley and Mischka at a talk after their show entitled \u201cDemystifying Digital,\u201d together with Jen Morgan, executive board member, global customer operations, SAP North America. Rocha said the fashion industry has been slow to embrace tech. \u201cIt\u2019s an industry that always thought it was ahead of the times in everything,\u201d she said, \u201cbut for tech it was never ahead of the times. They were slow thinking about it and got scared. But they\u2019re going to come to realize that there is a lot of useful tech they can use.\u201d She added: \u201cThis isn\u2019t our grandpa and grandma\u2019s generation anymore where we hem and haw about stuff. Fashion kids can tell immediately if they like something or not.\u201d Rocha thought the app marked an economically significant moment in fashion. \u201cUsually if their clothes don\u2019t sell, the designers have to buy back their clothing and that\u2019s a huge debt to them,\u201d she said. \u201cSo you\u2019re saving time and money with an easy app for people to use. If everyone uses this app, they will save a lot of money in their own companies.\u201d She also viewed the fashion week runway app as a throwback. \u201cIt\u2019s funny how we\u2019re going forward but we\u2019re actually going backwards at the same time,\u201d Rocha said. \u201cA hundred years ago a tailor would make a suit exactly to my body. It was all about how it would look great \u2018just for me.\u2019 We\u2019re going back to that using technology.\u201d \u201cThere was huge uptake for the app \u2014 the vast majority of people at the show were using it,\u201d said SAP\u2019s Mitchell-Keller. \u201cThis is just the tip of the iceberg. There are a lot of other things we could do with this app in terms of allowing customers to make comments and allowing buyers to actually place an order.\u201d She added: \u201cI know that IMG [the entertainment and sports management company which operates fashion week] wants to sit down with us and many of the designers and work out how can we can potentially do something similar for other designers. I think it\u2019s just the beginning.\u201d Tom Teodorczuk is a MarketWatch entertainment writer in New York. Tom Teodorczuk is a MarketWatch entertainment writer in New York.
