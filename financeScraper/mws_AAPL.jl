{"text": "Published: Technical analysis can help point the way in uncertain times By The stock market is complex. The number of inputs is staggering. Setting aside the complexity, the simplest thing investors can do to gain valuable insight is to look at patterns. To explore what might be next for stocks, let\u2019s look at a chart.   Please click to see an annotated chart of S&P 500 futures Similar conclusions can be drawn from popular ETFs such as S&P 500 ETF Nasdaq 100 ETF and small-cap ETF It is more instructive to use a futures chart because futures trade overnight and there is a very important point on the chart that is visible only on the futures chart. Please note the following from the chart: \u2022 In recent history, most of the very shallow dips formed a V pattern. In a V pattern, the dip is bought and the market recovers. When the market dipped this time, many were expecting a V bottom. The chart shows that a V bottom did not occur. This was addressed in the early stages of the stock market dip, when many gurus were predicting a V bottom. From the Morning Capsule made available to subscribers of The Arora Report: \u201cIf the stock market continues to go up from here, it would have formed a V bottom yesterday. Historically, V bottoms are less common than the retest. If a retest were to occur, the market would fall back to yesterday\u2019s lows. The momo [momentum] crowd likely has stops under yesterday\u2019s lows. A typical scenario would be hunt-and-destroy algorithms to become active, take out stops of the momo crowd and then for the market to rebound. If a retest occurs and it fails, then the probability of something more than a garden-variety correction will rise.\u201d This observation has now proven spot on. A V bottom did not occur this time. \u2022 The chart shows that a retest of the prior low marked with a horizontal white line is in progress. \u2022 The chart shows two scenarios from here on that will result in a bullish W pattern. These are shown with green dotted lines on the chart. \u2022 The chart also shows two scenarios if the retest fails. This will be a bearish break. These scenarios are shown with dotted red lines on the chart.        It is high time to remind investors of Arora\u2019s Second Law Of Investing: \u201cNo one knows with certainty what is going to happen next.\u201d The best way to handle uncertainty is to think in terms of probabilities. The probability of a bullish W pattern forming is significantly higher than a bearish break.   In addition to the simple chart, those interested in a comprehensive approach may look at The Arora Report timing model with inputs in 10 categories. The model is adaptive, i.e., it changes automatically with market conditions. To see the 10 inputs, please click .   Many investors are overly concentrated in technology.

{"text": "Asia continuing to increase in importance for Apple. Reports of lukewarm response to iPhone X in China proved to be false. Whole Apple product range showing strength in Asia. Asian macro economic factors suggest the continent will become increasingly vital for Apple. Of all the comments about Q1 2018 results for Apple (NASDAQ: ) many analysts have not emphasized how strongly Apple is performing in Asia. My predicted Apple's results would show stronger growth in Asia than anticipated. So it turned out. This shows how Asia will become increasingly important to the company and be the single strongest growth driver in coming years. An analysis of the illustrate the growth from Asia. The unaudited data summary shows this in relation to revenue as below: The net sales by reportable segment is as follows: The figures are striking. In terms of revenue year-on-year: Americas + 10% Europe +14% Greater China +11% Japan + 26% Rest of Asia Pacific + 17% In terms of revenue sequential change: Americas + 52% Europe + 62% Greater China +83% Japan + 88% Rest of Asia Pacific +144% The figures show that Asia is the fastest-growing sector in terms of growth in the medium term. In the short term they are very much the fastest-growing sector in terms of growth. Much of this huge accelerating growth short term is caused by the impact of the iPhone X. However it is backed up by the full product portfolio. In terms of net sales, China now represents 20.3%. Japan represents 8.2%. Rest of Asia Pacific represents 7.8%. That gives Asia 36.3% of total net sales for the company. On the , executives placed more emphasis on Asia than they had in the past with certain key comments. The iPhone X lead the charge in the region, but it was not just this model. This was despite negative calls by some analysts. As CEO Tim Cook stated: \"In urban China ...the top five smartphones last quarter were all iPhones...In Japan six of the seven were iPhones.\" As for the iPad, rumors of its death have been somewhat exaggerated. As Tim Cook said: \"In China, new and switching users made up over 70% of all iPad sales.\" So the product has a new lease of life there. Elsewhere, iPad enjoyed double-digit growth in India, Japan, Australia and Korea. As for the Mac, Cook contrasted: \"Worldwide 60% of our Mac sales were to first-time buyers and switchers and in China that number was almost 90%....We grew market share for iPhone in the quarter but we also grew share in iPad and Mac during the quarter and wearables were extremely strong.\" He pointed out also that although China numbers showed an 11% increase for Greater China, if one took this on an average weekly revenue basis, the numbers were up 19%. Double-digit revenue growth for a second quarter in a row hardly ties in with the picture some had tried to paint of a decline in China. It is true that forecasts indicate a difficult year for mobile phone volumes in general in China in 2018. These may or may not turn out to be accurate. However there is no reason to suppose Apple won't increase its market share. Other new product developments hold out great promise for Apple in Asia. In a continent where cashless payment is increasingly king, Apple Pay continues to move ahead. As Cook exampled: \"Today you can use Apple Pay to take a subway in Guangzhou.\" This is despite the very well-entrenched cashless payments already on tap in the country. In Singapore Apple Pay also is to the MRT and bus systems there, as just one example. The company also is cooperating with local rivals. It just recently that it will now accept \" \" the system from Alibaba (NYSE: ) in its stores in China. Previously it had accepted \"Alipay\" on its digital stores. In a way the company had little option but to cooperate with the world's largest mobile as an online payments platform. Augmented reality is very big in China as well, and this fits well with Cook's enthusiasm for it. As he stated: \"I am a huge, huge believer in AR. We put a lot of energy on AR moving very fast.\" Cook is wise to emphasize this. Chinese heavyweight companies Alibaba, Baidu (NASDAQ: ) and Tencent ( ) all have substantial mobile AR initiatives under way. These are not just in the world of gaming (inspired by Pokemon \"Go\") but involve tourism, education, healthcare and entertainment. The situation with home automation is similar in China and elsewhere in Asia. Governments in the region worry about increased labour costs and ponder how to enable \"smart cities.\" The Apple \"Home Pod\" is likely to be greeted positively in the region. As last year detailed, the new products from Apple seem to be perfectly geared to appeal to Asian consumers. Brand loyalty and mobile lifestyles are paramount. Apple's well-known halo effect where the iPhone leads into the whole Apple infrastructure is taking off around the region. This just replicates what was seen in North America, Europe and Japan in the past. Tim Cook has shown that he is in China for the long term. He also has shown that he's willing to cooperate with the Chinese government and make compromises where necessary. Apple's in the country was set up at Guizhou, at a cost of US $1billion. A at Ulanqab in Mongolia is now set to open in 2020. The iPhone will continue to lead the charge. Those observers who over the years state that iPhones will be too expensive for the Chinese market have been proved wrong time and again. Last year as , the iPhone 7 Plus was the second best selling model in the country, only just below the much cheaper Oppo R95. The iPhone 7 was the fifth best seller. Worldwide Appl its biggest competitor Samsung (OTCMKTS: ) in 2017. Its Korean rival has been hit by a lack of excitement in its new models. Similarly Chinese manufacturers have been waxing and waning. Huawei, Oppo, Vivo and One Plus have all seen sales decline after an initial surge in their new low-cost models. Each one was previously cited by some analysts as sounding a potential death-knell for the iPhone in the country. According to from Kantar, the iPhone was the top-selling model in China in the last quarter of 2017. came out with a figure of 7 million sold in China in the last quarter of 2017 out of 29 million sold worldwide. These are just the latest datapoints illustrating the way in which expensive iPhones are able to sell well in China. The iOS market share in China rose 10.1%. The also seems to be finally turning in Apple's favor in China. The renminbi is at a three-year low against the US dollar. The past strength of the US dollar has enabled Apple to invest more cheaply in the country. Now a weaker US dollar improves Apple's US dollar profitability in its ever more important overseas markets. The U.S. government policy on the dollar is incoherent but it seems likely Trump himself wants a cheap dollar policy which will benefit Apple's profit figures. Exact sales figures for the Apple Watch are not broken down by the company. It is generally considered though that sales are very strong in China, as I . China already is the t for watch sales. The new Watch 3 has had some due to lack of LTE connectivity of the new eSIM chip, but this is only a short-term problem. Elsewhere in Asia luxury watches are big business. For instance Singapore, a very small country, is nevertheless the world's tenth largest watch market. Local telecoms company Singtel is now for the new Watch 3. Australia, Hong Kong and Japan are up and running. Others will follow suit within the next few months. On the back of this Apple's health applications such as \"Health Kit\" and \"Research Kit\" and the open-source \"Care Kit\" should resonate strongly in the region. They tie in with various Chinese Government initiatives in this regard. The wearables market is set to boom in Asia and especially in China, as I in June last year. The growing population of Asia, its youth dynamic beloved of economists and the region's GDP growth means Asia will only become more important in the short term, in the medium term, and in the long term. There are 4.3 billion people in Asia. This represents 60% of the world's population. Currently it is only 34% of the world's GDP. Its percentage share though is growing rapidly. The graphic below illustrates world economic GDP activity as calculated by the World Bank. Asia's 34% of world GDP contrasts with 28% for North America and 21% for Europe. Its lead in share of world economic GDP will only increase as its economies and demographics are favourable. This shows up clearly in IMF forecasts. GDP growth figures going forward for all countries in Asia can be viewed in the Apple's recent increasing reliance on Asia is only set to increase on the basis of the above data. Many of the benefits in China apply elsewhere in Asia. Amongst these is Apple's build-up of stores in the region. They have been somewhat late to do this, as I have written about Asia represents 36.3% of total net sales for the company but has only 11% of worldwide stores. Now they seem finally to be making up for lost time. The is for a huge \"global flagship store\" in Melbourne. This will be only the fifth such store worldwide. There are currently 22 stores in China where iOS market share grew 1.2% in the final quarter of the year. New stores have recently opened in Singapore (said to be the second busiest in the world), Bangkok and Seoul. Japan meanwhile continues to be the standout market for Apple in Asia, and perhaps worldwide. It was no surprise that the iPhone X jumped to being the in the country with an 18.2% market share. The best selling phone in the country was the iPhone 8. Last year over half of all mobile phones sold in the country were from Apple. 46% of tablets sold in the country are iPads. An of mine detailed the great depth of the Apple brand in the country where iOS market share is over 50%. Apple Pay has been flourishing there on the transit systems, despite the already advanced state of contactless payment in Japan. It is integrated with the Osaifu Keitai mobile wallet system which you see everywhere in the country. The company is driving its gaming revenue in Japan in conjunction with Nintendo ( OTCMKTS: ). This is very likely to be another strong growth stream for apple in the country. Apple products particularly appeal to the Japanese because of their minimalism and design features. However the market in general is an indication of what Apple could achieve elsewhere in Asia. Brand loyalty is a major driver to sales all around Asia. This is especially true in the IT space. The three most in the Asia Pacific region are Apple, Samsung and Sony (NYSE: ). India will be a huge driver of future growth in Asia for Apple. I will be covering that big topic in a separate article. India has the potential to be another China story for the company and increase further the vital importance of the region for Asia. Asia is what makes Apple still very much a potential growth company. Apple's valuation metrics though are very low and certainly not those of a growth company. For instance if you compare Apple to the S&P US BMI Information Technology sector: PE 16.42 (S&P 31.2). Price to Forecasted Earnings 13.84 (S&P 21.75). Price/Sales 3.38 (S&P 4.21). Price / Tangible Book 6.13 (S&P 6.03) Price / Cash Flow 14.02 (S&P 18.77). The latest stock market turmoil only adds to the attractive investment potential in the long run. Apple's growth in Asia is faster than in any other region. The region itself is a faster growing region than any other in the world. Apple's product mix reflect what Asian consumers want. Its increased retail roll-out in the region is important for consumer branding and service. In my opinion the growing importance of Asia to Apple has been underestimated in many quarters and will only grow.   I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

{"text": "Menu Source: Shutterstock A stock market correction has a habit of revealing bargains, the way a falling tide may reveal sunken treasures in the mud. (NASDAQ: ) is looking like one of those bargains. At its Feb. 9 opening price of $155.50, AAPL stock is selling for less than 16 times earnings, and while , you should still get that 63 cents per share dividend (or more) this spring, yielding 1.62%. Despite what was termed a disappointing quarter, Apple is still growing. Its sales of $88.2 billion in the fourth quarter were up 12% from the $78.3 billion of the same quarter the year before. The percentage of sales that went to the net income line, 23%, was even higher than a year earlier. Then there is all that cash \u2014 $163 billion going into stock Even after that, the company will still have the capability of writing a check to pay off its $122 billion in debt, if that were needed. Apple covers its dividend with income by nearly four times over, meaning there is plenty of room for another permanent hike. The cash being repatriated comes to a whopping $32 per share. Bret Kenwell calls Apple to buy on the current pullback. (NYSE: ) . The February losses dropped it another 2.75%. Since the start of February, Apple is down 7.3%, while the is down 8.5%. Apple was last selling at these prices in late October. That\u2019s not to say Apple, and the market, can\u2019t go lower. At the end of trading Feb. 8, the average stock was trading at a multiple of 24.1. That is high by historical standards. With interest rates higher, rising dividends like those at Apple become less interesting, and growth no longer draws the premium it once did. The question now becomes, what can Apple do from here? Apple\u2019s fourth quarter report included . This makes things like the iCloud and Apple Music its second-largest business, behind only the iPhone. It is also Apple\u2019s fastest-growing business, rising 34% year over year. It\u2019s services that make the launch of , the company\u2019s answer to Alexa from (NASDAQ: ), so important. Apple is late to the market, as it often is, but it will likely be able to sell the HomePod as a . That should at least assure it a niche in the market, and . HomePod then becomes a means by which many other services are sold. Apple has the cash to make HomePod . Security is getting Apple , working alongside (NASDAQ: ), which knows that market. As to the iPhone 8 and X, which many analysts considered a bust when they were first announced, some of their best features, like power management, are . Phones don\u2019t just have the initial sell-through anymore. Apple has a huge business rehabbing and reselling phones, giving them a longer life in the market. What is happening right now is that the stock market is falling. Apple is not. The stock market is falling because interest rates are rising, and you can now get a safe return of 3-4% on your money, something that wasn\u2019t possible before. The economy is still growing at a good clip. Apple is growing faster than that, it\u2019s profitable, and while the go-go days are over, you can still make money in AAPL stock at these levels.

In any discussion of  these days, there's no escaping the subject of its legal troubles. The antitrust limelight shone on the company again last month after it was slapped with another fine, this one from the E.U.'s European Commission. Qualcomm's battles with regulators and customers are frustrating because they distract from the strides it's making in new growth opportunities including 5G, and the Internet of Things (IoT). Up-and-coming is already knee-deep in IoT, and as it demonstrated last quarter, it's working. With a market capitalization of just $631 million, Sierra may get overlooked by many investors. That's actually a good thing for a couple of reasons. Its IoT focus offers it limitless opportunities, as do Qualcomm's product diversification initiatives. So: Which is the better buy? Image source: Getty Images. Unfortunately for\u00a0Qualcomm shareholders, fiscal 2018's first quarter ended as the prior quarter did: With a massive fine, in this case, a $1.2 billion . Qualcomm intends to provide a \"financial guarantee\" as it battles the EU in court. Like other tech giants, Qualcomm's numbers took a temporary boost from the U.S. tax overhaul. Its conflicts with once again took a toll, but there were also several bright spots for Qualcomm. Excluding one-time items, total revenue of $6.04 billion was a 1% improvement year over year. As expected, earnings per share declined (thank you, Apple) 18% to $0.98 a share. Qualcomm's adjusted earnings are nothing to brag about, but there's a caveat. The highly profitable licensing unit's sales were just $1.3 billion last quarter, a 28% decline. However, as Qualcomm pointed out, a year ago, licensing revenue from Apple totaled $740 million. The iPhone maker has been withholding its royalty payments: If you add that figure back into the mix, Qualcomm's QTL division revenue would actually have risen 13% to $2.04 billion. First-quarter results were better than expected, but questions still loom. buyout bid for the company is still pending, as is Qualcomm's own long-standing offer for . There are also concerns about the slowing smartphone market in China, a nation whose sales are a key growth driver for the company. But, like its legal troubles, the China situation is likely a near-term hiccup, not a long-term problem. Image source: Getty Images. Growth investors in search of a pure-play IoT stock would be hard-pressed to find a better alternative than Sierra Wireless. The fact that its total revenue climbed 13% to $173.24 million last quarter was a feather in its cap. Better still was the way Sierra improved its top line -- with growth in each of its three divisions. Sales to original equipment manufacturers (OEM), Sierra's largest business, climbed 8.4% to $138.5 million, followed by a 39% jump in enterprise solution sales of $26.3 million. Sierra's IoT product offerings also include cloud and connectivity solutions. In the smallish, but fast-growing, cloud and IoT connectivity segment, revenue was $8.4 million, up 23% compared to a year ago. Due in part to increased product development spending, operating expenses rose 16% last quarter to $57.54 million. However, excluding a one-time charge of $2 million for Sierra's , and a $600,000 rise in amortization expenses, the increase in overhead would have been a more modest 11%. Sierra's gross margins improved an impressive 17% last quarter, more than offsetting its higher expenses. That, along with Sierra's revenue growth, boosted EPS to $0.04, a far better result than the loss of $0.06 a share a year ago. For bargain hunters, Sierra is valued well below its peers by virtually all metrics, including share price that's a meager 16.7 times forward earnings. A year from now, Qualcomm shareholders will likely look back in relief that its worst days are over. Until then, the company continues to expand its product portfolio to take advantage of the limitless opportunities IoT, 5G, and similar markets represent. Oh, and let's not forget that while they wait, shareholders will enjoy a dividend that currently yields 3.35%. The relatively small size that leads many investors to miss Sierra may be one reason its stock is such a value, but it's a positive for another reason. Given the massiveness of the IoT market already -- let alone where it's headed -- Sierra won't need to dominate connectivity, OEM, or enterprise segments to dramatically move its revenue needle. Because of those things, as well as its recent performance and slow-but-steady revenue diversification, Sierra Wireless gets the nod as the better stock.

{"text": "Published: CUPERTINO, Calif., Jan 23, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) --\nHomePod\u2122, the innovative wireless speaker from Apple\u00ae, arrives in stores \n      beginning Friday, February 9 and is available to order online this \n      Friday, January 26 in US, UK and Australia. HomePod will arrive in \n      France and Germany this spring. HomePod delivers stunning audio quality wherever it\u2019s placed \u2014 in any \n      room in the house, playing any style of music. Using just your voice, \n      it\u2019s easy and fun to use, and works together with an Apple Music\u00ae \n      subscription for a breakthrough music experience, providing access to \n      one of the world\u2019s largest cloud music libraries. Siri\u00ae, now actively \n      used on over half a billion devices, has developed a deep knowledge of \n      music and understands your preferences and tastes. And with Siri, \n      HomePod can send a message, set a timer, play a podcast, check the news, \n      sports, traffic, and weather, and even control a wide range of HomeKit\u2122 \n      smart home accessories. \u201cHomePod is a magical new music experience from Apple. It brings \n      advanced audio technologies like beam-forming tweeters, a high-excursion \n      woofer, and automatic spatial awareness, together with the entire Apple \n      Music catalog and the latest Siri intelligence, in a simple, beautiful \n      design that is so much fun to use,\u201d said Philip Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior \n      vice president of Worldwide Marketing. \u201cWe\u2019re so excited for people to \n      get HomePod into their homes, apartments and businesses to hear it for \n      themselves. We think they will be blown away by the audio quality. The \n      team has worked to give Siri a deeper knowledge of music so that you can \n      ask to play virtually anything from your personal favorites to the \n      latest chart-topping releases, simply by saying \u2018Hey Siri.\u2019\u201d   At just under 7 inches tall, HomePod represents years of hardware and \n      software innovation:   HomePod is designed to work with an Apple Music subscription for access \n      to hundreds of genres, moods and activities. It also learns preferences \n      and tastes that are shared across devices. Using Siri to deliver deep \n      knowledge of artists, songs, albums and more, HomePod can handle \n      advanced searches within Apple Music\u2019s catalog, so users can ask \n      questions like, \u201cHey Siri, when was this song released?\u201d or \u201cHey Siri, \n      can you play something totally different?\u201d to change the mood. Apple \n      Music subscribers can enjoy a catalog of more than 45 million songs, \n      combined with their entire iTunes\u00ae library, for online or offline \n      listening \u2014 completely ad-free.   HomePod is a convenient way to send messages, set timers and reminders, \n      check the weather and listen to shows on Apple Podcasts. The latest \n      business news, headlines and sports updates stream directly to HomePod \n      from NPR, CNN, ESPN and others. HomePod can also be used as a \n      speakerphone with iPhone for crisp and clear audio quality. With support for HomeKit, HomePod can control hundreds of home \n      accessories or set scenes like, \u201cHey Siri, I\u2019m home,\u201d to control a \n      number of different accessories at the same time. HomePod can turn on \n      the lights, raise the shades, set the desired temperature or make other \n      adjustments and serves as the perfect home hub, enabling remote access \n      and automations.   Through SiriKit\u2122, HomePod supports third-party messaging apps, so users \n      can ask Siri to send a message to a friend or colleague using apps like \n      WhatsApp. Reminders, note-taking and to-do list apps like Things and \n      Evernote will automatically work with HomePod, so Siri can set \n      reminders, create a new list, mark items as complete, or create and \n      modify notes. For developers interested in adding SiriKit support, more \n      information is available at .   Coming this year in a free software update, users will be able to play \n      music throughout the house with multi-room audio. If HomePod is in the \n      kitchen, users can ask Siri to play jazz in the dining room, or play the \n      same song in each room \u2014 perfectly in sync. If there's more than one \n      HomePod set up in the same room, the speakers can be set up as a stereo \n      pair for an even more immersive sound experience.   Security and privacy are fundamental to the design of Apple hardware, \n      software and services. With HomePod, only after \u201cHey Siri\u201d is recognized \n      locally on the device will any information be sent to Apple servers, \n      encrypted and sent using an anonymous Siri identifier.   HomePod is available at an Apple retail price of $349 (US) in white and \n      space gray in the US, UK and Australia and available to order beginning \n      Friday, January 26, from and the Apple Store\u00ae app. HomePod will be available in Apple Stores and \n      at select Apple Authorized Resellers, including Best Buy in the US; \n      Argos, Dixons Carphone (Currys PC World), John Lewis, Shop Direct (Very \n      and Littlewoods), EE, and Apple Premium Resellers in the UK; and The \n      Good Guys, Harvey Norman, JB Hi-Fi, Myer and Telstra in Australia, \n      beginning Friday, February 9. HomePod will be available in France and \n      Germany this spring. HomePod is compatible with iPhone\u00ae 5s or later, iPad Pro\u00ae, iPad Air\u00ae or \n      later, iPad mini\u2122 2 or later, or iPod touch\u00ae (6th generation) with iOS \n      11.2.5 or later.

{"text": "Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Never has a corporation done so much with something so little. Founded in 1968, Intel Corp. ( ) has been the world\u2019s leading manufacturer of microprocessors and chipsets almost since its inception. Today Intel is easily the largest semiconductor company in the world, about half again as large as closest competitor, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., and more than triple the size of the next-largest domestic producer, Qualcomm Inc. ( ). What separates Intel from most other semiconductor companies is that it fabricates its products in-house. The bulk of semiconductor \u201cmanufacturers\u201d farm the actual work of creating the products out to foundries in China. Intel even fabricates chips for other companies, for the most part ones too small to be considered true competitors. Is that a conflict of interest? Not really. Fabrication plants can cost several billion dollars to build, and it makes sense for Intel to keep its busy. (For more, see: .) Intel does indeed assemble chipsets in China, but at Intel-owned facilities. It is received wisdom among some American doomsayers that low labor costs make China the default base of manufacturing operations for U.S. corporations that want to save a few pennies per unit and \u201cship jobs overseas.\u201d That claim is more accusatory than it is true. At the end of 2016 Intel had\u00a0a multitudinous workforce of 106,000, approximately half of\u00a0whom were employed in the United States. Almost half of Intel\u2019s chipsets and microprocessors are manufactured at home, at facilities in the suburbs of Phoenix, Albuquerque, N.M., and Portland, Ore. Outside of China, most of the remaining Intel products are developed in Israel. (For more, see: .) Even given that Intel fabricates other companies\u2019 chips at its facilities, the business of developing internal computer hardware, selling it, and branding it is more incestuous than you might think. For instance, as of 2007 Apple Inc. ( ) began using Intel chips exclusively in its Macs, supplanting the PowerPC CPUs that Apple itself helped develop as part of a consortium. In 2018, it was that Apple may use Intel chips exclusively in its new iPhones.\u00a0By comparison, smaller companies subcontracting to Intel isn\u2019t even that big of a deal. Intel\u2019s surviving cofounder, Gordon Moore, lends his name to the most famous observation in all of technology. Formulated in 1965, states that transistor density doubles every two years. Not only has the observation held ever since, but Intel has officially incorporated the law into its company strategy. The company is behind the development of 450mm wafers, the widest in existence, yet still less than a millimeter thick. Once in production, they should allow the exponential progress of Moore\u2019s Law to continue for at least another generation. So who\u2019s buying all these Intel chips? In 2008, the answer was unambiguous. Hewlett-Packard Co. ( ), Dell and International Business Machines Corp. ( ), not coincidentally the three-biggest computer manufacturers at the turn of the century, were together responsible for $3 of every $4 Intel took in. A mere six years later, with bulky personal computers no longer the devices of choice for a global clientele that values portability and speed, Intel now has eight major customers that are responsible for 75% of its revenues. In 2016, Intel's three largest customers were responsible for 31% of the firm's accounts receivable. Intel might obey Moore\u2019s Law, but the (a.k.a the 80/20 rule) is a different story. Intel\u2019s revenue growth has slowed dramatically since the beginning of the decade. Never mind the limits of integrated circuit density, has Intel come up against the limits of the growth to revenue? The people who run Intel are far from stupid, and the company\u2019s transition from monolithic desktops to smaller devices has been underway for a while. Capitalizing on the of its market-leading position, Intel has shifted its concentration to smaller devices and embedded systems. The latter refers to chips placed in something other than stand-alone computers, which can include everything from cars and planes, to traffic signals and factory assembly lines. Like any corporation of its size ($205.7\u00a0billion ), Intel has an elaborate business organization. The company\u2019s major divisions include the\u00a0Client Computing Group;\u00a0which includes desktop computers, notebooks, and tablets,\u00a0the Data Center Group; which includes products for cloud communications and infrastructure, and the\u00a0Internet of Things Group;\u00a0which includes products designed for internet connectivity in areas like retail, transportation, industrial, video, buildings and smart cities. In addition to semiconductors and chips, Intel also produces security software products. The era of the 30-pound table-mounted mini tower might be fading, but it\u2019s still very much active and will be for a while. 55%\u00a0of Intel\u2019s operating revenue comes from its Client Computing business, a ratio that lowers gradually from one year to the next. Dell Inc. is the company\u2019s biggest customer, accounting for 15%\u00a0of Intel revenue. Right behind at 13%\u00a0is Lenovo Group Ltd., which bought IBM\u2019s personal computer business in 2005 and immediately became a huge Intel client, almost by default. Intel grossed $62.8\u00a0billion in 2017. Its business is truly international, with the United States only its second-biggest market. The biggest customer is China, which bought nearly $14 billion worth of Intel products last year. The third-largest\u00a0market is Singapore, which accounted for $12.7 billion of Intel's revenue. Some companies dominate an industry, fail to innovate, and fall into irrelevance (e.g. Howard Johnson, Kodak.) Others have great ideas but never manage to capitalize on them. The company that can leverage intellectual firepower with commanding market share is the company that can stay both powerful and relevant for decades. Intel is the archetype, and is situated to continue to be, well into the future. Want to learn how to invest?

{"text": "Published: LOS ANGELES, January 24, 2018 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ --\nLOS ANGELES, January 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --     - Used for all types of operations, like merchandise payments, ticketing, money transfers, and bill payments, US mobile payment transactions are now projected to reach a value USD$2.849 trillion in the year 2020- . The sky-high potential of this market is well known already to many FinTech investors, and development companies in the sector that includes  (cse:GET),    and   The study, which used 2015 numbers (USD$550 billion) as the base year for analysis, expects a whopping CAGR of 39.1% through to 2020, . In terms of use widespread use of mobile payments, China far outdoes the US, at more than 50 times the current usage. Already, -so Western developers and marketers can see what is a possibility down the road. Widespread acceptance in China of major mobile payment platforms has led to major gains from developers of platforms such as Alipay from (BABA) and TenPay from (TCEHY)-which hold a 54% and 37% market share, respectively. In North America, however, though the market is already above USD$550 billion, there is still plenty of growth expected that will come with the adoption of easy-to-use mobile payment apps. Such apps that are changing the way we pay for everything from toys to avocado toast, include Google Wallet from  Apple Pay from  Samsung Pay from  and the fast-rising restaurant app Glance Pay from (OTC: ) (CSE: ).   Possibly the fastest moving of any sector in North America, in terms of sheer number of transactions, is that of the food industry. After the rollout of fast food brand Subway's stores with self-ordering kiosks that feature support for mobile payments, a survey was done to determine how many fast food eaters use mobile payments. According to the survey, it was found that had used mobile payment services in the prior month. Much of that comes from Asia Pacific markets, where 51% of respondents said they had used their phones to pay the bill in the month before. Those included the trialed use of \"smile to pay\" , supported by Alibaba's Ant Financial affiliate. While lower in comparison to their Asian counterparts, fast food eaters in Europe (32%) and North America (26%) are a consumer base that's higher than average in their respective regions for paying via mobile. Therefore, a more wide-scale adoption can be expected to come through the food industry, perhaps faster than through big-box retail stores, such as Walmart and Target which have also recently launched mobile payment apps for their respective chains. One company that is looking to corner the market on mobile payments in North American restaurants, is (OTC: ) (CSE: )-developers of the popular and secure app Glance Pay.   Diners are becoming more accustomed to using an app to improve their dining experience-whether it's . Convenience is key, and time is precious for eat-in diners-especially during the noon-day lunch hour, when no one wants to be busted returning late to back to work. Restaurant owners also want to , resulting in higher revenues during their establishment's prime times. The more diners they can serve in an hour, the higher the likelihood that their eateries will survive. In an effort to shave valuable minutes off of everyone's least favorite part of the dining experience (paying the bill), Glance Pay from Vancouver-based developers,  (cse:GET) is improving the dining experience for customers across North America. Streamlined and designed to revolutionize how we dine, Glance Pay is a mobile payment platform helping users choose where to dine, order goods and services, make payments, access digital receipts, redeem digital deals, earn great rewards & interact with merchants. Easy to use for both diners, and restauranteurs, Glance Pay is spreading wide across its home country of Canada and soon into the US and Europe in the near future. Already, popular chains and independent restaurants are adopting Glance Pay, including Ricky's Restaurant Group with almost 150 locations in Canada, and Canada with 52 locations across the country. Seeing Glance Pay as a brand leader-or potential Uber, or AirBnB of the restaurant industry- often ranked as InsTech's #1 FinTech Influencer in the world, joined the Advisory Board of Glance Technologies. \"I'm in love with Glance's simplicity and arena of business. In some ways it's like Uber, in terms of convenience. However, I think that its placement in the restaurant business is something that could turn into a huge success story,\" said Margaris upon the . At the time of Margaris's addition to the team in late September, Glance's stock was trading at $0.375-Since then, the stock has hit a 52-week high of $3.20. \"If they can replicate what they've already done in Canada, in the US and worldwide, it'll be a billion-dollar company,\" added Margaris. \"If it enters a major US centre at the beginning of next year, and executes in a popular state such as New York, I can see a $5 share price. The sky's the limit.\" In addition to Glance Pay's ease of use, it's the app's stellar security record that has further driven its widespread acceptance. As of November, Glance Technologies officially announced its fraud on the app. Further improving upon its anti-fraud expertise, Glance Pay has introduced its own cryptocurrency which corresponds with the app's built-in customer loyalty incentives for both the restaurants and the app itself. Much like the addition of Margaris, Glance brought in more expertise, through the , Dinis Guarda to the Advisory Board. Along with the appointment, Glance acquired Guarda's company Ztudium's cryptocurrency technology, . Much like the majors and their platforms, such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay etc., Glance Pay is gaining momentum across multiple outlets, in many sectors. However, its strongest sector remains in the food industry. Unlike for Apple, Google, and Samsung, investors in Glance Technologies still have plenty of blue-sky to look forward to, as they build out the brand either to market dominance, or being bought out by a major.      Alphabet Inc., more popularly known as Google, provides global online advertising services, as well as performance and brand advertising services. The Google segment includes principal Internet products, such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, Android, Chrome, Wallet and Google Play, as well as technical infrastructure and newer efforts, including Virtual Reality. Google Wallet is an encrypted app meant for peer to peer transactions. Alphabet Inc. was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Mountain View, California.    Apple designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise, and government customers worldwide. Apple's Apple Pay is the company's contactless payment system for mobile phones, launched in 2014, and growing in popularity. Apple Pay is now available in millions of stores, like Nike, Ulta, and can be used online and in other apps and websites such as Airbnb and Lululemon.    Samsung together with its subsidiaries engages in the consumer electronics, information technology and mobile communications, and device solutions businesses worldwide. The company provides mobile payment and communication system services, as well as manufactures and sells server semiconductor storage system. Samsung's mobile payment system, Samsung Pay, is designed to replace the plastic cards in your wallet. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. was founded in 1938 and is based in Suwon, South Korea.

Shares of General Electric dropped after traders learned that the SEC is probing the company's accounting practices. RDI Initiates Coverage on: Apple Inc.   General Electric Company   Apple Inc. shares closed down 1.59% on about 51 million shares traded on Wednesday. The tech giant is preparing to roll out a new feature on its iMessage that allows users to directly chat with businesses through the platform. It's called Business chat and will be debuting this spring. The feature was initially announced last year at the company's Worldwide Developer Conference and will launch with partners that include Wells Fargo and Discover. Despite this promising news, the stock closed in the red. Facebook commissioned a study by Nielsen that revealed last fall that a majority of customers would rather message a business than call its customer service number. 56% of the respondents had said they would rather text than phone. Apple also announced that the very first store in South Korea will be opening in Seoul this Saturday.

The advertising that occurs during the Super Bowl has become almost as iconic as the game itself. When the Big Game made its TV debut in 1967, the accompanying ads hadn't yet become the cultural touchstone they are today. Although opinions differ, it was sometime in the early 1970s that advertisers began to ramp up their offerings for the game-time ads. It wasn't until the release of 's groundbreaking commercial that same year that the ads became a phenomenon and an event unto themselves. Streaming giant  captured a massive amount of buzz when it dropped a trailer at the end of the first quarter for the J.J. Abrams-produced , the third installment in the sci-fi trilogy. Seeing movie trailers during the Super Bowl is nothing new, but Netflix turned the paradigm on its head by revealing that viewers could watch the movie just hours later -- right after the end of the game. Netflix generated hug buzz for by rolling out the debut of the thriller right after the Super Bowl. Image source: Netflix. It is well established that the television network that shows the Super Bowl will typically try to hijack viewers by airing a special episode of a highly rated program or launching a long-awaited new series. Netflix turned this practice on its head by offering fans a much-anticipated movie that had seen no previous advertising and made it available immediately after the game. Viewers are deeply divided about the movie itself, which was alternately described as mind-blowing, horrifying, or just plain terrible. That is, however, beside the point. The quality of the movie (or lack thereof) doesn't detract from the brilliant strategy and execution by Netflix, drumming up interest by taking a time-honored tradition and adapting it to work for streaming television. The move generated a massive amount of attention. \"No other streaming service has ever pulled off this type of stunt, nor released a movie with such immediacy. Millennial audiences love surprises and this type of marketing maneuver is right up their alley,\" according to Deadline Hollywood, calling Netflix's action a \"groundbreaking, unprecedented move.\" \"The stunt nature of this release alone is enough to generate the kind of social media buzz money can't even buy,\" said . Netflix's first foray into Super Bowl advertising came last year, when the company released of its smash hit . That commercial generated the most buzz of any ad seen during the game. Netflix CEO Reed Hastings has been encouraging his team to take more chances, saying last year, \"We have to take more risk; you have to try more crazy things.\"\u00a0Apparently the marketing team took that advice to heart. Netflix has taken some big swings in the past year. The release of the is reportedly one of the company's most costly bets to date, at an estimated $90 million. The company also made the first acquisition in its history, bringing into the fold, and has recently signed celebrated producers Shona Rhimes, Jenji Kohan, and Shawn Levy. Moves like this are paying off. When Netflix recently announced its , the company's subscriber growth soared past its own ambitious forecasts. Netflix added 1.98 million domestic subscribers, up 10% year over year, and outpacing its estimate of 1.25 million. International subscribers grew by 6.35 million, up 41% over the prior-year quarter and vastly exceeding its expectations for 5 million new subs. Netflix's ability to \"take more risk\" may result in a higher failure rate, but it will also produce worldwide hits like , , and . Nice move, Netflix. Daniel W.

Rising interest rates and bond yields are the main theme behind the selloff so far. However, Washington\u2019s inability to pass a spending bill is creating an undue amount of uncertainty. Congress once again forced a government shutdown last night after failing to reach an agreement. Against this backdrop, futures are down 0.5%, futures have lost 0.25% and futures are up 0.27%. Turning to the options pits, puts continued to dominate trading activity yesterday. Overall, about 22.3 million calls and 24.3 million puts changed hands on the session. The CBOE single-session equity put/call volume ratio spiked to 0.75. The 10-day moving average hit a three-month high, arriving at 0.65. Taking a closer look at yesterday\u2019s options activity, (NASDAQ: ) attracted heavy call volume following news that preorders for its just released HomePod have sold out. Elsewhere, (NYSE: ) call volume rose after the company dropped $486 million for a stake in a domestic big-data firm. Finally, (NASDAQ: ) continues to be dogged by Model 3 production concerns. Let\u2019s face it. Apple was late to the game with HomePod \u2026 really late. Luckily for Apple, however, the walled garden it has created around its devices and PCs left enough pent-up demand for the company\u2019s (NASDAQ: ) Echo clone. So much so, apparently, that . However, as analysts have pointed out, it\u2019s still too early to tell if preorder shortages are due to high demand or low product supply. Options traders appear to be banking on the former. Emboldened by Apple stock trading near key support at $150, AAPL options traders piled into calls yesterday. Volume topped 591,000 contracts, with calls making up 64% of the day\u2019s take. What\u2019s more, Apple\u2019s March series has grown increasingly popular with options bulls. The March put/call open interest ratio has fallen from a reading north of 0.90 to its current perch at 0.69 in the past month. In other words, calls have been added at a faster pace than puts in the back-month series. This action typically indicates rising bullish sentiment, which Apple hasn\u2019t seen for some time. Alibaba has paid out $486 million for a according to \u00a0a filing on the Shenzhen stock exchange. Shiji Information provides software and data systems to hotel firms, retailers and entertainment companies. According to Shiji, the move is part of a \u201cnew retail\u201d strategic cooperation designed to use big-data to shake up China\u2019s huge retail market. Alibaba stock options traders viewed the move positively. Volume rose to 339,000 contracts, with calls making up 58% of the day\u2019s take. Yesterday marks the end of a streak for BABA stock that saw puts dominate options trading volume. Looking out to the March series, it clear that there is still a ways to go for options sentiment. The March put/call OI ratio has risen from last month\u2019s lows near 0.55 to its current reading of 0.68. As such, recent call volume might have been the result of position closures instead of actually bullish call adds. It will be a trend to keep an eye on for BABA bulls. Tesla reported earnings that initially sparked a rally in the shares. Traders initially focused on the company\u2019s better-than-expected cash positions. That bullish sentiment faded fast, however, as Model 3 production delays continued to worry investors. In fact, Tesla only delivered 1,550 Model 3s in the fourth quarter, which is a little more than half Wall Street\u2019s expectations. Those worries deepened yesterday, sending the shares down more than 8% and driving mixed options volume. Roughly 240,000 contracts traded on TSLA stock yesterday, with puts and calls split down the middle. Looking out to March, negativity is dominant. The March put/call OI ratio has risen to a near-term high of 1.44, with puts easily outnumbering calls in the series. In fact, peak call OI totals more than 5,500 contracts at the crucial $300 strike as traders place bets on technical support in the area.

Unlike ,   doesn't produce an integrated smartphone product. Instead, the search giant has chosen to focus on its strength, its Android operating system, while allowing others -- most notably -- to focus on the hardware. There's a slight exception to this arrangement: the Google Pixel phone, for which it works closely with the hardware producer to design the unit. And the company is inching closer to full integration on this front. After announcing its intention to acquire part of Taiwanese consumer hardware giant HTC Corporation last year, Alphabet officially closed on the $1.1 billion deal in late January. Image source: Alphabet. The HTC acquisition is notable in what it includes. In addition to a non-exclusive agreement to license HTC's intellectual property, Alphabet received 2,000 HTC engineers as \"acqui-hires,\" many of whom worked on prior versions of the Google Pixel, and HTC's smartphone development team. Alphabet hardware executive Rick Osterloh wrote in a blog post, \"I'm delighted that we've officially closed our\u00a0deal with HTC, and are welcoming an incredibly talented team to work on even better and more innovative products in the years to come.\" Make no mistake: Alphabet is moving toward integrating hardware and software. In the , Osterloh admitted, \"building hardware is ... hard.\" He's particularly correct as it relates to the premium smartphone market. While Alphabet's Pixel phone has received praise from tech reviewers and critics, it has failed to break the flagship duopoly of Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy line of phones. A recommitted Alphabet comes at a critical time for Apple. The iPhone maker is facing analyst concerns about its current flagship phone, the iPhone X. Multiple reports from . In the company's recently reported quarter, the company did sell fewer iPhones than in last year's quarter. However, it's likely the company with the most to lose from Alphabet's move is fellow Android hardware maker Samsung. In developed markets like the United States, where new phone purchases are mostly refreshes, the lock-in effects of operating systems are strong. Samsung has benefited from being the premium smartphone of choice on the Android ecosystem. If a more integrated Alphabet leads to a better product, then Samsung is likely to be more affected. It should be noted that Alphabet has attempted to manufacture an integrated smartphone before. In 2012, the company paid $12.5 billion to buy Motorola Mobility. At the time, Google appointed Dennis Woodside to run the division. \"Our aim is simple,\" Woodside said then. \"To focus Motorola Mobility's remarkable talent on fewer, bigger bets, and create wonderful devices that are used by people around the world.\" Alphabet reversed course two years later, selling much of Motorola Mobility's assets for less than $3 billion, although it kept many of the patents. As for Woodside, he's now the COO of Dropbox. However, it appears Alphabet has learned from its mistakes and that the current deal with HTC will not be another Motorola Mobility situation. Although it's a step closer to bringing forth a comprehensive smartphone solution, this appears to be a smaller, more strategic bet than the large-scale Motorola Mobility acquisition was. However, that doesn't mean Apple and Samsung should ignore Alphabet. The search giant has an advantage in the hardware wars because of the asymmetric risk/reward profile in comparison with its peers. Investors of all three companies should watch Alphabet's smartphone and hardware efforts closely.

{"text": "Menu Source: The news broke on Wednesday that the legendary Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas mogul for over 50 years, and the founder and CEO of (NASDAQ: ) had resigned. What does this mean for WYNN stock? It was a no-win situation for Wynn. In any other climate, this news could have been handled from a crisis PR perspective. But in the days of #metoo, the PR backlash is just so bad that Wynn really didn\u2019t have any choice. The board of directors has to explain to the world how it could keep Wynn at the helm given the allegations \u2014 and that\u2019s what they are, allegations. But these days, allegations are taken as truth. WYNN stock was up $15 on the day, more than 9%, because the market doesn\u2019t like uncertainty. Once there was certainty, the updraft in stock price was like a wave of relief. It\u2019s an unfortunate situation all around. It\u2019s difficult to determine the exact impact on WYNN stock over the long term, though. What I do know is that WYNN stock has lost a true visionary. That\u2019s what Steve Wynn is. He is not just a legend, but a man who intrinsically understands everything there is to know about gaming and resorts. For 50 years he held sway over the city of Las Vegas, starting from humble roots as a liquor salesman, and became friendly with the influential Frank Sinatra. Wynn launched the current and ongoing wave of the mega-resort, which began when he opened The Mirage in 1989. I remember it being built, and remember how it astonished everyone when it opened. That vision carried over to every resort over the next 30 years \u2014 each one trying to outdo the next. Wynn is a visionary on par with Steve Jobs of (NASDAQ: ) and Howard Schultz of (NASDAQ: ). Look what happened to those companies when the visionaries left their posts. That\u2019s what I fear for Wynn Resorts. But that may be all it is: fear. It\u2019s not as if Wynn, who owns about 21% of the company, will not have influence. I\u2019m sure that behind the scenes, he will have plenty of contact with new CEO Matt Maddox, himself being elevated from the position of president. It may not mean that Wynn is involved in every detail, but it seems unlikely that he\u2019ll just vanish. More likely than not, he\u2019ll return to the post in a couple of years after all of this has blown over. In the meantime, WYNN stock has been on an upswing with the Macau crackdown finally ending. I\u2019ve never seen Wynn Resorts stock as an investment vehicle. The company is more cyclical in nature, and I\u2019ve found it better as a trading vehicle, or a stock to use options with. There are plenty of ways to generate profit in WYNN stock other than just going long and holding. I have no doubt that Maddox will steer the company just fine going forward. And because I see WYNN stock more as a trading vehicle, a long-term growth trajectory doesn\u2019t matter anyway.

{"text": "Apple's large buyback program is on the verge of reauthorization in April. We have long been advocates of allocating the capital to dividends, paying down debt, and acquisitions. With the current market correction, we now believe Apple should binge on its share buyback. Our criticism of Apple's ( ) cash allocation is no secret. Apple has exploded its in order to spend on dividends and buybacks over the last five years, from nearly $0 to over $120bn now. It has hardly been an exciting acquirer, too, with bolt-on acquisitions never exceeding a few billion here or there. The last 30 days, however, have knocked Apple's share price roughly 10%. And with the market sell-off, it does not seem to be stopping there. Given the new TTM PE ratio of 15.9 at the share price of $155, we are moderating our position and hope Apple opens the pocketbook to retire even more shares as the market correction continues and the share price falls below $150. At the outset, we are truly happy that Apple has decided to begin working on the debt. After the recent earnings announcement - - we see a serious effort to address the debt load. It will be pulling back on its debt appetite, opting to quit tapping the debt markets and begin to use its cash. Apple currently has a net cash position of $163bn (cash/securities minus debt) and the debt has also been increasing with its cash: We are also still holding out hope that Apple embarks on a sizeable special dividend for shareholders. With around 5bn shares outstanding, a $2 or $3/share special dividend would certainly spark interest in the stock and reward shareholders for their patience as Apple has sat on its absurd amount of cash for the last several years. More likely, instead, is a sizeable increase to its quarterly dividend. Some Seeking Alpha investors claim a 50% and also would pique the interest of many potential buyers. We reported on Apple's capital expenditure intentions following the tax bill: Apple it will spend up to $350bn over the next few years investing in America. It will seek to hire 20,000 workers as part of this expansion. This figure includes the $38bn in deemed repatriation taxes owed under the new bill, noting \"a payment of that size would likely be the largest of its kind ever made. \"Planned capital expenditures in the US, investments in American manufacturing over five years and a record tax payment upon repatriation of overseas profits will account for approximately $75 billion of Apple's direct contribution. Apple also seeks to expand its presence in Hollywood, r . With plans on spending upwards of $1bn on original content, the company is continuing its foray into the space to compete with the likes of Amazon ( ) and Netflix ( ). Currently Apple has roughly $34bn left to spend on share buybacks. It is this number we hope the company plans on spending this week, and in weeks to come, as we are hitting real weakness in the stock: We now agree that the strategy of spending on buybacks given the weakness of the stock is getting better by the day. Our argument against extending the authorization has evolved for a number of reasons, but the simple story is that now Apple is beginning to get a better deal. Say Apple wanted to acquire a company for a price of $30 (Twitter (NYSE: ), for instance). Now imagine, as Apple was pondering such a deal, the price per share rose to $35/share. Then to $40. Then to $45. What would we think of management continuing to pursue such an acquisition as the price kept increasing for the same target, all else being equal? Eventually cooler heads might prevail and convince the powers that be that it is - in essence, the price is now too expensive. Why should this idea not apply to a company seeking to buy back its own shares? At some point, it ceases to have the same value as it once did, and management would be wise to reconsider. We to begin winding down its buyback at $150/share in August - today, Apple shares sit at $155. Should they continue to fall, we will join the chorus of investors cheering a higher buyback authorization since the shares are finally beginning to be a good deal once again. We again quote the great on the wisdom of continuing to buy back shares as prices increase: [T]he question of whether a repurchase action is value-enhancing or value-destroying for continuing shareholders is . It is puzzling, therefore, that corporate repurchase announcements almost never refer to a price above which repurchases will be eschewed. That certainly wouldn\u2019t be the case if management was buying an outside business. There, . When CEOs or boards are buying a small part of their own company, though, they all too often seem oblivious to price. Would they behave similarly if they were managing a private company with just a few owners and were evaluating the wisdom of buying out one of them? Of course not. (emphasis added) At the least, Apple should inform shareholders at what price the company will consider buying more shares and at what price does it cease to be value-enhancing. As Buffett explains, if Apple was acquiring a company, surely the price it is paying would be of utmost importance. Why not when buying its own shares? If Apple gave more insight into their buyback strategy, it also would give investors an idea of what kind of intrinsic value management ascribes to the company. All we ask is that Apple not remain \"oblivious\" to the price it pays for its shares. Investors should be kept abreast of what constitutes fair value in the eyes of management, rather than the same reasons for buybacks that are always trotted out (management believes shares are undervalued...). We believe the recent sell-off and upcoming buyback authorization are prime opportunities for Apple to inform its shareholders about its strategy and the price it intends to pay. Apple is starting to get a better deal on its buybacks. Should the price continue to fall, we are now of the mind that spending up on buybacks is a laudable use of its cash. We hope that the price action continues to offer investors, and Apple, a better buying opportunity for years to come.   I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

Shares of Netflix were on a rampage after an analyst said the company is yet to hit its subscriber growth peak. The streaming company soared to a new high. RDI Initiates Coverage on: Apple Inc.   Netflix, Inc.   Apple Inc. shares closed down 2.07% on Monday on about 50.6 million shares traded. The stock saw trading volume almost double compared to usual yesterday. Shares of the tech company went south after reports revealed that Apple has told its suppliers to cut iPhone X production in half to 20 million units for Q1. According to the Nikkei report, which cited unnamed supply-chain sources, \"Apple will halve its production target for the iPhone X in the three-month period from January from the figure of over 40 million units envisaged at the time of its release in November. The U.S. tech giant notified suppliers that it had decided to cut the target for the period to around 20 million units, in light of slower-than-expected sales in the year-end holiday shopping season in key markets such as Europe, the U.S. and China.\" The Nikkei report also stated, \"Apple is believed to have started considering an increase to proportion of liquid crystal display iPhone models by reducing production of the OLED screen models scheduled for release this year.\" Access RDI's Apple Inc.

On Monday MKM Partners analyst Rob Sanderson raised his 12-month price target on the stock from $245 to $320. Considering that this is a 17% premium from this past Friday's closing price, it had traders pretty excited. The analyst wrote in a note that his price target raise was a result of the company's fourth quarter earnings it recently released. Netflix had reported impressive subscriber growth and according to Sanderson, the company's subscriber growth could be still years away. He wrote, \"While there is certainly a bullish sentiment surrounding the stock, we think that many investors still underestimate the Netflix story particularly with respect to the penetration opportunity around the world.

{"text": "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. If you were offered the choice of $1 or $0.83, no strings attached, I suspect you'd make the rational choice and take $1. After all, $1 is more than $0.83, and having more money is better than having less money, right? Well, some companies like  think that the answer isn't necessarily that obvious. The private equity giant is thinking about changing its corporate structure so it pays more in taxes, resulting in lower earnings, which might actually be good news for its stock. Maybe. Companies are valued based on their earnings, so a company that earns more should theoretically be worth more than a company that earns less, all else equal. That's the obvious, mathematical and logical conclusion. But the real world operates under different rules where sometimes things don't always make sense. KKR and its private-equity peers including  and  aren't normal corporations. They're partnerships, which gives them certain controversial tax benefits that result in exceptionally low tax rates. KKR's effective tax rate is normally in the neighborhood of 5% to 10%, much less than the 35% rate most corporations paid last year, and still less than the current 21% tax rate. Paying almost nothing in taxes is cool, but being a publicly traded partnership (PTP) has its disadvantages, of which the biggest is that some investors simply won't own them. Individuals don't like them because they don't want to deal with . Mutual funds won't own them because pass-through entities make their funds score poorly for tax efficiency. Plus, most stock market indexes exclude partnerships for much of the same reason: The funds that track the indexes don't like the marketing problem of passing on a tax burden to people who invest in index funds. The people who make the indexes get paid by the people who run the funds that track them, so index makers largely of the funds who pay them . No surprise there. Stocks are priced based on earnings, but they're priced based on supply and demand. If more people can buy your stock, then maybe your stock might trade at a higher price. At least that's what KKR, Blackstone, and Apollo -- as well as the analysts that follow them -- have been trying to figure out. KKR explained the issue pretty succinctly in its most recent conference call. In order for it to justify the conversion from a partnership to a C corporation, and thus pay higher taxes, its ratio would have to increase from roughly 9.3 times earnings to about 11.2 times earnings to basically break even for its investors. In other words, if earnings drop 17%, the price-to-earnings multiple has to go up about 24% for the stock price to stay the same. Of course, it's entirely possible that KKR's valuation actually goes up even more after converting, in which case its existing shareholders are made wealthier by the fact the company will actually earn less money. This guy doesn't know $0.83 is worth more than his $1 bill. Image source: Getty Images. Look, I know this all sounds really silly, but I'm not going to rule out the possibility that private equity stocks trade at higher prices if they were ordinary corporations.\u00a0After all, if they could get into stock market indexes, all the index funds that track the indexes would have to buy shares of the private equity companies. Since index funds do more holding than buying or selling, they'd take a lot of stock off the market, and would be forced to slowly increase their holdings as more money piles into index funds with each passing day. Index funds have become a powerhouse in the market, so it's not entirely unrealistic. Funds managed by Vanguard, , and are commonly ranked as the top three owners of public companies. (For perspective, funds managed by the \"big three\" own about 14% of .) Actively managed funds obviously own a lot of stock, too, though like index funds they also tend to shun publicly traded partnerships, but they might buy KKR or Blackstone stock if they were structured as your everyday corporate entity. No one can say for sure, though. For now, the one thing standing in the way of a corporate\u00a0conversion is that no private equity company wants to be the first one to take the plunge, preferring to wait for someone else to be the lab rat test subject for a study on whether making less money is actually a good thing. Who will go first? Some think is a likely candidate to convert, since\u00a0more of its income is derived from management fees, which don't get the preferential tax treatment that incentive fees do. Since this is the topic-of-the-hour in private equity, I'm sure we'll hear more about this issue on Ares Management's next conference call. Truthfully, this whole ordeal wouldn't be as interesting if it involved any other industry.\u00a0Private equity firms are often portrayed as ruthless number crunchers who will do anything to turn $1 into $2, so it is kind of funny that KKR is starting to wonder if its next act should be turning $1 into $0.83. I think stock investors can benefit by analyzing a company with a credit investors' mentality -- rule out the downside and the upside takes care of itself.

Owners of a HomePod that doesn\u2019t have AppleCare+, or is out of warranty, will pay $279 for the repair. There\u2019s also a shipping fee of $20. This has the repair cost sitting at almost the same as a new HomePod, which is\u00a0$349. It makes shelling out the $39 for AppleCare+ not seem so bad.

{"text": "Menu Source: Shutterstock This just in \u2014 (NASDAQ: ) is still losing money. During the December quarter that had SNAP stock defying the biggest market correction in a decade, Snap spent $646 million to bring in . This was a lot more than the $208 million in revenue earned the previous quarter, but it still represented a loss of $350 million, or 28 cents per share. Snap is like a clothes designer coming up with snappy Nehru jackets when the market has gone to pinstripe suits. A year ago, even a month ago, Snap\u2019s blowing away estimates of $253 million in revenue, by over 10%, would have had this writer cheering, maybe even buying. With the stock winds blowing colder, not so much. The question today isn\u2019t whether Snap is going to find a big-pocketed buyer or become another (NASDAQ: , but whether it will be around at this time next year. At the end of this \u201cstellar\u201d quarter, Snap had $2.043 billion in short-term investments on the books, essentially ready cash. It\u2019s spending about $650 million per quarter on operations and only getting half that back in revenue. It could be out of cash by mid-2019 unless something good happens. The reason people are getting bullish on SNAP stock is because they think Snap Inc. is getting significantly better at monetization. \u00a0Its new SNAP store is a demonstration of how . The bullish thesis is that Snap appeals to younger users who are abandoning Facebook, but that these users are still just as anxious as their older brothers and sisters to support brands that advertise on the platform. That may be true. It may also be false. Regardless, it\u2019s an assumption, not a proven fact. When a market downturn reveals bargains, you buy bargains. There are some good stocks now selling at bargain prices. (NASDAQ: ) is at 16 times earnings. (NYSE: ) just increased its dividend and will soon be yielding 7.3% if you want income. (NYSE: ) is selling at 13 times earnings. The point is not to recommend any of the above stocks, but to simply point out that there are great bargains in the wreckage of early February and you don\u2019t have to chase a quick buck. If you want to gamble, buy bitcoin (BTC). Even if you buy the idea that the SNAP stock glass is half-full ( ), you can still wait for it. There is some good news to digest in Snap\u2019s latest quarter\u2026 there is also some bad\u2026 and . Those who equate Facebook to SNAP are also forgetting that Facebook owns its own cloud and SNAP doesn\u2019t. This means Facebook can pivot into other businesses, as it has with Instagram and Messenger. When SNAP adds features, Facebook creates similar features \u2014 and Facebook has enough cash to play this game out for as long as you like. Facebook is the cat, Snap is the mouse. SNAP will reply that its users don\u2019t just reject Facebook, but anything having to do with Facebook, including But that is still a niche audience. Facebook does not have first-mover advantage over Snap. It has second-mover advantage. It learned from MySpace, beat it, and has scaled. It has a fortress balance sheet, $41 billion in cash against $14 billion in annual expenses, almost $85 billion of real assets, including a network of cloud data centers. Facebook knows the answers to questions SNAP hasn\u2019t even asked yet. SNAP may gain a niche, but it won\u2019t win the market. It may make money, but it\u2019s not going to be Facebook.

Today is 's HomePod day! The Mac maker has officially launched its first smart speaker today, and while initial reviews , this could just be the beginning. The company is facing an uphill battle against market leaders and  subsidiary Google, whose respective families of smart-home devices dominate the space today. That's thanks in part to an expansive portfolio of devices that caters to a wide range of use cases and price points. One product perched at the high end of the spectrum to make a dent in the market. Apple really needs to launch a more affordable smart speaker that's not tailored to audiophiles, so consumers can buy multiple units to place all around their homes without breaking the bank. Image source: Apple. Rosenblatt analyst Jun Zhang has just put out a research note (via ) suggesting that Apple could have a more affordable HomePod in the pipeline. Zhang believes that HomePod preorders are strong, selling\u00a0out yesterday ahead of today's launch. The analyst is modeling for HomePod production of 6 million units this year, which would translate into about $2.1 billion in revenue that would inevitably be booked in Apple's \"Other products\" segment. Perhaps more importantly, Zhang believes that the company is planning on launching a more affordable HomePod as early as this fall at a retail price point of $150 to $200. Amazon and Google aggressively cut\u00a0prices during the holiday shopping seasons. Google clarifies that its price reductions are for a limited time, but Amazon does not. It's not clear if the reduced Echo prices are permanent, but it's conceivable since Amazon does like to give cost savings back to consumers as product cost curves naturally come down over time. Here are the current listed prices for each company's smart-home product portfolios, and where a theoretical \"HomePod Mini\" would fall in Apple's lineup. Data source: Company websites. Prices do not reflect potential volume discounts. *Rumored. Releasing a HomePod Mini at $150 to $200 could go a long way toward making Apple's lineup more competitive. Not everyone wants (or can even discern) high-fidelity audio, undermining the value proposition of the $350 HomePod. If the company were to start moving downmarket, $150 to $200 is probably as low as it would go. Apple doesn't like to compete solely on price, and tends to still position itself at a premium even when releasing more affordable products. It's difficult to imagine the company releasing a smart speaker at $100 or less. While such a device would strengthen Apple's position in the smart speaker market, it still has plenty of work to do on other fronts, like improving Siri's capabilities and third-party smart-home integrations through HomeKit.\u00a0Amazon has garnered significant momentum, and Google is about to accelerate its smart-home strategy by .

{"text": "Published: LONDON, Jan. 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --  Assisted or Augmented Reality (AR) represents a live (direct or indirect), view of a physical, real-world environment in which certain elements are augmented by computer-generated sensory input. In addition to a visual overlay, AR may also provide audio and tactile inputs to the user, and rely upon presence and positioning technologies to present location-specific sensory inputs and information to the user. In this manner, AR represents a blending of information technology and media within a real-world environment for the benefit of consumer, business, and industrial users.    Download the full report:     The term Mixed Reality (MR) pertains to a form of hybrid reality in which physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real-time. With MR, either virtual objects are digitally mixed into reality or real-world objects are merged into virtual worlds. The latter case is sometimes referred to as Augmented Virtuality (AV), and is one step closer to Virtual Reality (VR), as real-world objects in a virtual world take on a sense of permanency with real objects, appearing to actually exist within the virtual world.  Adding to this sense of permanency, real-world objects in a virtual world may be digitally controlled. Conversely, MR may also support manipulation of virtual objects permanently placed in the real-world. In either scenario, MR will be an important aspect of teleoperation and tele-robotics.  The primary goal of AR is to enrich the user's perception of the real-world, providing information and insights that otherwise would not be obtainable. AR use cases have grown substantially across many industry verticals within the last two years, providing significant market momentum, and indicating great promise to transform communications, content, and commerce across a wide range of sectors. The goals of MR are broad, yet directionally focused on a true merging of real and virtual worlds, which Mind Commerce believes will be a major catalyst for wide-spread acceptance and usage of VR across all major industry sectors.  This research assesses AR, MR, and other immersive technology components, the AR/MR ecosystem, and competitive landscape. The report evaluates market opportunities for hardware, software, and services. Analysis takes into consideration market drivers and constraints such as potential regulatory implications.

{"text": "Published: Inflation fears were blamed, but then bond prices flipped that story on its head By Before Friday\u2019s stock market rout, which pales in comparison to Monday\u2019s biggest point-decline ever, everything was coming up roses for the U.S. economy. Synchronized global growth, low inflation, solid job creation, a strong sense of optimism among businesses and consumers, robust corporate earnings, aided and abetted by the recently enacted tax cut: What\u2019s not to like? All that changed Friday with a single statistic in a single economic report that fanned \u201cinflation concerns\u201d and triggered a synchronous stock and bond market selloff, at least according to press reports. Monday\u2019s 1,175-point, 4.6% dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was accompanied by a huge rally in Treasuries, more than erasing Friday\u2019s losses. \u201cInflation concerns\u201d clearly took a back seat to \u2014 let me guess \u2014 flight-to-quality buying? The price action in markets drives perceptions about the economy. But reality doesn\u2019t change nearly as quickly, which is why simplistic explanations often vanish with the next day\u2019s price action. Let\u2019s take a look at a case in point.  featured a story, \u201cTech Giants Power to New Heights,\u201d detailing \u201crecord quarterly financial results\u201d reported by Apple Inc. , Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. on Thursday. By Friday evening, following the Dow\u2019s devilish 666-point decline, those stellar results were now \u201cmixed,\u201d which provided readers a link to the earlier, seemingly contradictory story on the tech giants\u2019 record quarter. What changed? Perceptions, as viewed through the filter of the stock market: that\u2019s what. While it is true that the U.S. stock market has been overvalued for some time, based on metrics such as all it took was a two-day selloff to cast a shroud over weeks of optimism and price appreciation. To be sure, warnings about a bubble in equities, and even bonds, have been a standard feature of TV commercials (buy gold!) and analysts\u2019 reports for years. What set things in motion Friday, according to press reports, was news that had increased 2.9% in January from the prior year, just one of the data points in the monthly employment report. The increase represented the strongest wage growth since 2009. For years we have heard chronic complaints about stagnant wage growth from politicians and the public. And for years, the Fed has been fretting over its failure to hit finding some reason, transitory or idiosyncratic, to explain the chronic undershoot. All of a sudden, when wages show some sign of life, suggesting the labor market is tight enough, and demand for goods and services strong enough, for employers to offer higher wages to attract workers, that\u2019s a cause for alarm? When pressed, Fed policy makers have made it clear that a 2% annual increase in the personal consumption expenditures price index is not a ceiling. The Fed is even considering \u201cpotential alternate frameworks for the conduct of monetary policy,\u201d including price-level targeting, which would entail tolerating inflation in excess of 2% to offset the persistent undershoot, according to It sounds nice in theory, but I\u2019m not sure , given the \u201cinflation concerns\u201d fanned by Friday\u2019s report of rising wages. It was those fears that reportedly drove the yield on to a four-year high of 2.85% on Friday. Just to put things in perspective, 10-year yields are about 50 basis points higher than they were when the Fed\u2019s federal funds target rate was 125 basis points lower in December 2015. An increase in , not inflation expectations, has been the main driver of rising yields since the start of the year. If yields are rising because of stronger growth, that\u2019s a good sign, not a bad sign. So what about the rise in , the other key component of nominal bond yields? The Fed has been worrying that inflation expectations are too low, depressing actual inflation. Again, the Fed\u2019s goals are realized, and that\u2019s a reason to rewrite the script? Stocks have gone up so far so fast that a two-day, 8.5% decline in the Dow was enough to put fear in the hearts of investors and alter the backdrop of strong economic growth? Remember Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow fell 508 points, a loss of 23%? That was a big deal. Besides, if you are looking for early signs of a pick-up in inflation, don\u2019t let wages guide you. Prices lead wages, not the other way around. to deflate the notion of cost-push inflation decades ago, but the idea that costs push prices up keeps coming back. Besides, cries out for a new story. Inflation concerns are so, well, last week. My money is on investors fleeing stocks for the safety and security of U.S. Treasuries. That should work for a few days, at least until the need to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling reminds investors of the Treasury\u2019s massive borrowing needs this year.

{"text": "Published: Whether bracing for delays or hoping for none, Wall Street is keeping production of the sedan firmly in its sights By Wall Street is starting to sound like a broken record when it comes to Tesla Inc., but until the Silicon Valley car maker finds its groove, there\u2019s only one thing that matters. Yes, the Model 3. Tesla is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results after the bell on Wednesday, and investors are sure to parse every word the company utters about the Model 3 production ramp. \u201cOur concern has been really the same since September,\u201d said David Kudla, Chief Executive of Mainstay Capital Management. \u201cIt\u2019s the Model 3 and production delays that continue to be delayed even further. Are they going to delay again, or are they going to make progress?\u201d Tesla recently filed to do its first asset-backed securities deal, and the company has moved to quash renewed concerns about its production.    Meanwhile, its stock performance continues to outperform benchmarks and competitors, even though the company is expected to report a wider loss for the quarter. Tesla shorts, or those investors betting the stock will turn lower, have lost about $1.3 billion so far this year, according to recent data from financial analytics firm S3.       Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Tesla to report an adjusted loss of $3.11 a share in the quarter, compared with an adjusted loss of 69 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Estimize, a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from Wall Street analysts as well as buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, company executives, academics and others, has also projected an adjusted loss of $3.11 a share.  The FactSet revenue consensus is $3.3 billion, which would be up from $2.3 billion in the same quarter last year. Estimize has the same consensus.  Tesla\u2019s stock has gained more than 35% in the past 12 months, which compares with gains of around 20% for the S&P 500 index and 26% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  It also leaves in the dust the stock of competitor General Motors Co. which has gained 13% in the same period. Tesla stock gains contrast with losses of more than 15% for Ford Motor Co. stock.       Chief Executive Elon Musk has taken to twitter to , the company he started with the aim of boring underground tunnels to ease traffic congestion: Flamethrowers. \u201cI\u2019m the first to admit Musk is a genius,\u201d but it is unclear whether making money is his goal for Tesla, Mainstay\u2019s Kudla said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with the manufacturing process,\u201d he said, adding that he has shorted Tesla in the past year and made profits. There will always be people who love Tesla like they love Apple Inc. and will give the company and its CEO pass after pass but for its products and cachet. But ultimately, the company has to make money to be taken seriously,\u201d he said. Tesla and Musk recently , including growing to a market capitalization of $650 billion, more than 10 times the company\u2019s current market value. The announcement could have alleviated \u201crising concerns over key man risk,\u201d analysts at Nomura said in a recent note, as the new plan requires Musk to remain CEO or serve as both executive chairman and chief product officer in order for stock-vesting schedules to trigger. Tesla in early January That goal post, first set for 2017, then for the first quarter of 2018, has been moved to the second quarter of the year. The fourth-quarter report will be a \u201cde-risking event\u201d as Model 3 production continues to ramp, analysts at Baird said in a note Tuesday. \u201cWe are buyers ahead of (fourth-quarter results,\u201d they said. \u201cWe believe (Tesla\u2019s) recent decision to push out production targets has de-risked the stock, and the Q4 report could remove another overhang. Positive reviews of the Model 3 are likely to coincide with more deliveries to non-employees, which should strengthen demand and drive company shares higher, the analysts said. Tesla can fund the Model 3 ramp without raising additional capital, but a capital raise would remove an additional overhang, they said. Baird analysts updated their calls for 2018, saying they expect an adjusted loss of $1.57 a share for the year, which compares with FactSet consensus for an adjusted loss of $4.16.

{"text": "Published: Should apps contain privacy warnings similar to nutritional labels on food? By Soldiers using fitness tracking devices inadvertently revealed the locations of U.S. military bases \u2014 including classified ones \u2014 and the incident has lessons for anyone with a smartphone. The locations of several U.S. military bases through data from Strava, a San Francisco-based GPS tracking company, representing a \u201cclear security threat,\u201d according to one security analyst, the Washington Post reported. The Strava app is used with phones and popular devices like Jawbone, Fitbit and Vitofit. Its public \u201cheat maps,\u201d which show where there is high concentration of activity, revealed locations where troops were using it to train in Somalia, Niger, Syria and Afghanistan. Military bases aren\u2019t the only locations at risk of being exposed, a Feb. 7 study from mobile security firm found. It showed a security flaw in Strava\u2019s privacy zone feature that can triangulate the exact home address of users. Strava\u2019s \u201cprivacy zone\u201d tool lets users stop the app from tracking their activities around a specific address, presumably their home or workplace. Wandera researchers found that it\u2019s possible to triangulate the exact location of a person\u2019s address using the end points of users\u2019 activities. Strava did respond to requests for comment regarding either of these security breaches. These issues have underscored the importance of companies clearly explaining to consumers what data is shared on apps, said Mark Testoni, chief executive officer and president of in Virginia. He said there should be labels on apps regarding privacy, similar to nutritional labels on food.    Fitness tracking companies can pinpoint where people live, how often they sleep, and even when they are engaged in sexual activity based on data collected, said Mark Weinstein, a privacy advocate and chief executive officer of social network . Allowing apps to access photos is perhaps the most egregious permission, said George Avetisov, chief executive officer at HYPR, a security company . Apps use facial recognition technology and, in theory, can track you and who you spend time with. Case in point: Uber\u2019s \u201cGod view\u201d display the movements of specific users. The company reportedly used the tool as a \u201cparty trick,\u201d showing guests at a launch party a screen that showed all rides happening at a given time. An Uber executive also admitted to tracking the rider logs of a BuzzFeed News reporter. following these reports, the company a $20,000 fine. Testoni said there should be labels on apps regarding privacy, similar to nutritional labels on food. \u201cWe do not want to put people in harm\u2019s way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to look at this through a public policy perspective and make consumers more aware of the data being collected on us daily.\u201d Such a measure could be far away, experts say. In April 2017, Congress approved a reversal of protections implemented under the Obama administration that prevented internet service providers from collecting data from users. Now, corporations are to track user habits. Here are some measures to minimize risk of sharing sensitive information:   If you gloss over terms of service after downloading an app, you aren\u2019t alone: 91% of users accept legal terms and conditions without reading them, one from U.K. tax services company Deloitte found. This is a dangerous habit and an easy way to sign away your privacy, Weinstein said. \u201cScan them and look for things that jump out like location services,\u201d he said.   Within the terms of service on apps \u2014 often on a separate prompt screen \u2014 companies ask users permission to access features beyond location, including microphone, photos, camera, and contacts. Weinstein said to deny access to as many of these as possible, especially if the app is from a small or unknown company. Some apps allow users to enable microphone and other features only while using it, which decreases the amount of data collected at other times. That would be a wise move, Avetisov said. \u201cAre these apps pulling this data maliciously? The truth is that most app users are allowing this data to be used the moment that approve the app\u2019s permission settings,\u201d he said.   Although convenient, signing into apps with existing accounts on Google or Facebook puts users at higher risk for hacking and provides more data to those companies to track and sell, Mark Weinstein said. Make a separate log in and password for every single account, and use a password manager to keep track of them.   If you\u2019re not using your app to hail a ride or find a restaurant, consider turning off location settings completely. On Apple devices, users can go to \u201csettings,\u201d \u201cprivacy.\u201d It will cut down on tracking and save battery power. For Android devices, \u201d \u201clocation,\u201d \u201cGoogle location settings.\u201d That simple maneuver would have helped those U.S. military personnel protect their location.

{"text": "Published: To maintain a leadership role, Qualcomm forges partnerships with 18 companies By Qualcomm, under pressure to show value and growth amid a looming hostile takeover bid from Broadcom, is hoping that its position in the market for next-generation cellular-radio technology will be a foundation of its future. The company revealed today partnerships with 18 global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that will be launching 5G-ready devices in 2019. A total of 18 worldwide cellular carriers will be completing tests of Qualcomm 5G radios in 2018. 5G is the follow-up iteration to the current 4G cellular technology in most of the world\u2019s smartphones. It will improve the speed of connectivity, lower latency and transform markets from self-driving cars to industrial automation. And it can do all of this while lowering the load on carrier networks, giving all users a noticeable increase in performance and usability. Qualcomm has been leaning on this 4G-to-5G transition as a portion of its long-term plan and strategy for many years. As a part of the company\u2019s recent call to action for shareholders to  the San Diego-based company believes that it has a 12- to 24-month lead over competing connectivity providers, namely Intel This position will allow Qualcomm to capitalize on what many believe could be the most disruptive and market-shifting wireless transition in history. To maintain a leadership role, despite mass-market availability being limited to 2019 products, Qualcomm has announced partnerships with 18 OEMs that will build those products using the Snapdragon X50 modem. The modem was the first announced to support the finalized specification of 5G radios. OEMs like LG, HTC, Sony, Asus and Vivo are committed to using the X50 modem in devices ranging from next-generation smartphones to Windows-based PCs. There has been talk that 5G products would not be available until 2020, but Qualcomm believes that 5G will have an impact on revenue a year earlier than that. This collection of phone and device providers puts Qualcomm well ahead of Intel in terms of integration and support in the market, something Qualcomm has believed would be the case but is only now finally confirmed. Commercialization of 5G and collaborations with the leading device manufacturers will push Intel further back in the race, with time running out for it to catch up. Two big OEMs are missing from the list in Qualcomm\u2019s announcement: Samsung and Apple While it makes sense that Apple would not want to be included in the public statements from Qualcomm considering the legal dispute between the two companies, there is a legitimate question as to whether Apple will be an early adopter of 5G technology at all. It has shown in the past that it is more than willing to let others experiment and drive wireless technology shifts on the networks, with both the iPhone 3G and first iPhone with LTE (iPhone 5) lagging behind other smartphones by several quarters. If Apple chooses to not integrate the Qualcomm modem, it will depend on Intel to provide a product instead, and could miss out on 5G technology for all of 2019. Not seeing Samsung as a part of this announcement from Qualcomm is more surprising, but likely an omission of politics than of technology. I recently wrote about the extension and expansion of the licensing and it is unlikely that this contract would not have included the X50 modem for 5G. I expect the 2019 models of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy devices to include the Qualcomm chip as well. The second part to this story is that 18 global cellular carriers, including Verizon and AT&T in the U.S., China Mobile and SK Telecom will be testing 5G with Qualcomm devices and infrastructure in 2018. These validation tests are used to demonstrate the capabilities of new wireless technology and finalize the implementation methods for the hardware in the field. These two announcements put Qualcomm in the driver\u2019s seat for 5G adoption and integration. 5G will offer consumers speeds that are up to five times faster than today\u2019s top offerings, lower latency for more responsive web browsing and new capabilities like streaming virtual reality. It will make Wi-Fi less necessary. The cellular carriers will take advantage of 5G for its ability to run more data through existing infrastructure, opening capacity for more users, devices and upgradable services.

{"text": "Published: For most companies, mum\u2019s the word By The movement to address the widespread prevalence of sexual harassment and even assault is creeping into the boardrooms of prominent corporations \u2014 but it\u2019s not clear yet whether companies are updating their policies when it comes to dealing with such claims. The #MeToo movement was sparked last fall after bombshell reports in the New Yorker and the New York Times disclosed . Since then, similar allegations have brought down numerous men in the entertainment industry, from to \u201cToday\u201d anchor . This trend has not left corporate America unscathed. Even before the Weinstein allegations came to light, claims of sexual harassment . More recently, Wynn Resorts Ltd. Chief Executive and Chairman Steve Wynn after facing scrutiny of pressuring female employees to perform sex acts. Those claims have prompted investigations by gaming regulators in Massachusetts and Nevada. The Massachusetts Gaming Commission revealed that Wynn Resorts paid to a woman who claimed that Steve Wynn forced her to have sex with him.    The way in which Wynn Resorts handled the sexual-assault allegations lobbed at its founder is not atypical of corporate America. Many companies follow similar protocols in mediating such disputes, said Brian Kropp, who leads the human-resources practice at the consulting firm Gartner. \u201cWith some companies, their playbook on how to respond to claims of sexual harassment is 30 years old,\u201d Kropp said. To this day, many companies will handle such allegations by having human resources perform an internal investigation. If the claims look to be true, the victim will get some sort of financial payout, while the harasser will be reprimanded \u2014 or fired, if the allegations are particularly egregious. However, the deliberations are for the most part kept under wraps. \u201cThey want to minimize risk and exposure for the company,\u201d Kropp said. \u201cThat mind-set still permeates how a lot of organizations are approaching sexual harassment today.\u201d Some companies have chosen a newer approach \u2014 one that gets to the core of the company\u2019s culture. In these instances, the companies are instilling a sense of equity across the organization. That includes measures that ensure equal pay and efforts to promote more women and people from other underrepresented groups, Kropp said. \u201cIt\u2019s thinking about all the systems within a company that create a perception of unfairness,\u201d he said. \u201cSo rather than trying to manage risk, they are creating a culture where it\u2019s not allowed.\u201d A recent study from hiring firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas found that felt compelled to re-evaluate their sexual harassment policies in light of the #MeToo movement. Of those, only 25% chose to update their guidelines.    So what decisions to this end are being made in the boardrooms of the 30 companies that form the Dow Jones Industrial Average ? It\u2019s tough to say. MarketWatch reached out to all 30 companies, asking them to comment on whether they\u2019ve updated their policies related to sexual-harassment claims in light of recent events. Only 10 of those companies provided comment. The lack of response shouldn\u2019t be surprising though, Kropp said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to respond to questions about what they do or don\u2019t do because every response that\u2019s out there is discoverable if a lawsuit occurs,\u201d he said. Here is what the companies that have responded have had to say:     said that any inappropriate behavior that violates the company\u2019s goals related to mutual respect will not be tolerated, even if the actions aren\u2019t illegal. \u201cEmployees at every level are required to report any behavior that would interfere with a fair and respectful workplace, and complaints are investigated promptly,\u201d the company said. Employee concerns can be raised to leadership and human resources or through 3M\u2019s reporting system, which provides the option to remain anonymous.     said that sexual harassment in the workplace isn\u2019t tolerated and that reports of sexual harassment are investigated. The company further reviews policies relating to harassment \u201cin a timely manner and update them as needed,\u201d it said.     said it continuously looks at its already strong policies, with every allegation vigorously investigated. The company\u2019s indicate that Apple will not \u201ctolerate discrimination or harassment of employees or non-employees with whom we have a business, service, or professional relationship.\u201d     described itself as \u201ca values-based company\u201d in a statement. The company trains all employees on its code of conduct, which includes \u201crobust anti-harassment policies,\u201d on an annual basis, it said.     said it focuses on corporate culture as part of its approach to addressing concerns surround misconduct. \u201cWe believe that preventing sexual harassment is not just a matter of having sound policies, but having a culture in which employees are comfortable bringing their concerns forward and calling out inappropriate behavior when and if it occurs,\u201d Cisco said. \u201cOur focus is on ensuring that all Cisco employees are cognizant of the power dynamics and are committed to fostering an environment in which every employee is heard, valued and is in a position to be their best at work.\u201d The company added that it \u201cunequivocally\u201d prohibited harassment and discrimination through its code of conduct and harassment prevention policies.     has not updated policies related to sexual harassment in reaction to recent events, but a company spokesman said that the company reviews and updates policies \u201calmost annually\u201d to meet changes in the law and in best practices. \u201cWe reissued our policy recently as part of our standard practice. In light of recent events,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cWe also reminded all employees of our policy and of our leadership\u2019s commitment to that policy.\u201d     said it does not tolerate sexual harassment. The company has open reporting channels and encourages employees to come forward through them if they have been subject to inappropriate conduct. Those allegations are then \u201cimpartially investigated,\u201d and \u201cswift disciplinary action\u201d will occur as needed. The company\u2019s general counsel recently sent a memo to all employees reiterating the company\u2019s zero-tolerance policy and its transparency in handling these matters.     also said it has a zero-tolerance policy for \u201canyone who violates our value of respect for all people,\u201d a company spokesman said. Home Depot maintains an open-door policy to encourage anyone to report incidents of harassment, which is backed up with regular training, according to the company.     was yet another company that said it has a \u201czero-tolerance policy when it comes to sexual harassment.\u201d Managers, it said, are required to complete annual training.   . referred to Chief Executive Jamie Dimon\u2019s note to employees in June in which he wrote that employees should not refrain from reporting any unethical conduct. \u201cIf you see something wrong \u2014 or think it isn\u2019t right \u2014 say something,\u201d Dimon wrote. \u201cRaise the issue and report it. We rely on your personal integrity to protect and enhance the firm\u2019s reputation.\u201d    didn\u2019t offer a formal response, but the company has recently reissued its code of ethics. In a letter to employees, Chief Executive Gregory Hayes said that central to the code is a commitment to promote and support open communication, at all levels of the company. \u201cI encourage you to speak up and report activity or behavior that doesn\u2019t seem right,\u201d Hayes wrote in the letter. \u201cThere are multiple channels available to employees to report concerns either directly or anonymously.\u201d He said the company takes each reported concern seriously and thoroughly investigates. \u201cWe will not tolerate retaliation against any employee who reports wrongdoing \u2014 regardless of the outcome of the investigation.\u201d Boeing Co.

{"text": "Published: Younger people prefer experiences over products, so smart marketers will combine the two By One of the most popular toys on the market this past holiday season was something called L.O.L. Surprise! The line of small dolls that children can collect and dress in various outfits flew off the shelves. But the unique thing about the dolls isn\u2019t what they wear, but how they are packaged. Rather than a typical box, each doll comes inside a large plastic ball that contains up to a dozen layers of different \u201csurprises,\u201d including stickers, charms, outfits and other accessories. The experience of opening this package is a large part of the appeal. opening each ball are generating millions of views on YouTube, which is also integrated into their brand site and has all manner of interactive features, printouts and \u201ccollectibles,\u201d bolstered by the highly downloaded \u201cL.O.L. Surprise Ball Pop\u201d apps. There may be no better metaphor for companies looking to connect with millennials (and clearly, their children). Today, how this generation experiences, communicates and shares information about products is in many ways more important than the product itself, and critical to brand building. Yesterday\u2019s shopping experiences are no longer relevant. With our devices, we\u2019re summoning rides through Uber, ordering groceries online via smart lists, subscribing to and binge-watching our TV shows through Netflix Everything is on-demand, everything is personalized and everything is available right now. And when we like our experiences, we share with those we care about. The lesson here: You\u2019d better understand, authentically connect to, interact, serve \u2014 and, yes, trust your consumers with your brand. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll be able to deliver value and loyalty. It is this reality that is driving three major interrelated changes in retail.   Millennials prefer offerings that feel unique to them as individuals rather than something that is generic or appeals to everyone. That said, the products themselves don\u2019t need to be customized to each individual. Products that feel personalized, through the experience of buying it reflect a company that knows how to communicate with its consumers and understands what they want. This can happen instantly and at scale through devices, driven by data about you and only you. The brands that have the most information about how people engage with their offerings and know how to weaponize that data through advanced analytics are going to be most likely to get personalized experiences right and drive value for both the consumer and the brand. For example, the way Apple approaches design and marketing, and the way it delivers on its value proposition are all about simplifying the complex and allowing individualism and self-expression. Nothing is more personal \u2013 or personalized \u2014 than what you experience and share through your phone. Apple\u2019s advertising reflects this. Deep connections between people and their preferred brands are becoming table stakes, not just for technology companies, but because of them. Consumers have been trained to expect personal, expect easy, and expect service.   Tightly connected to personalization through experience is the blurring between what we traditionally think of as a \u201cproduct\u201d manufactured by a brand and what we think of as a \u201cservice.\u201d Unlike products, services can be improved and updated 24/7, at relatively low cost. Again, we can thank the progressively higher capability and lower costs of advanced digital solutions for this. Sun Basket is a great example. A meal-kit delivery service with vegetarian, gluten-free and paleo offerings, the company studies its data to sharpen its offerings, creating highly personalized \u2014 even if not entirely customized \u2014 recipes. It can easily extend this service platform to provide new sources of growth and ways to serve an already loyal customer base. Or consider Thrive Market, which at first appears to simply be an organic e-commerce retailer. A deeper look shows that Thrive is actually selling a lifestyle with a robust business intelligence unit and an in-house content production team. It caters very specifically to its customers\u2019 behavior and feedback, particularly around the importance of a shared social mission. Its product sales enable this, but Thrive\u2019s proposition can stretch to other lifestyle choices beyond organic food. It\u2019s less about what you\u2019re selling and more about making sure that you\u2019re maximizing every single occasion for people to use your offering as opposed to others. Millennials are the first generation that is truly primed for this reality, and they\u2019re starting to expect it from the companies they buy from. Soon, I expect to see just about every brand having a service component to their offerings.   In the era of \u201cfake news\u201d it is perhaps not surprising that studies indicate that people trust other people more than they do brands. Due to the explosion of devices, people now create more information about brands and products, both good and bad, than any one company could possibly create themselves. Increasingly, this means the only way for brands to authentically reach people is to focus on how people are talking about their offerings to others, and to use this as a means of connecting with them. To be sure, a carefully crafted brand proposition is still key, but now in many ways your brand is really what people say it is when you are not in the room. Harness user-generated content and use it in your marketing strategy. Understand how the true perception of your brand (is it even yours anymore?) can positively drive how people search for, interact with and buy your products. Develop relationships and listen to your consumers. They\u2019ll tell you what they want. The time is now to invest in the new technologies that will make these insights possible and actionable. Companies that ignore these changes and hold on to the marketing tactics of the past increasingly do so at their own peril.   Join the conversation Copyright \u00a9 2018 MarketWatch, Inc.

{"text": "Published: Disney CEO Bob Iger said the company is developing a few \u2018Star Wars\u2019 TV series for its forthcoming streaming service By TV has been on a reboot bender of late, with announcement after announcement from networks that they are bringing back beloved series from the past. Networks have also taken risks and created some of the most creatively inspired and high-quality work on TV in years \u2014 shows such as \u201cAtlanta,\u201d \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cThe Good Place\u201d \u2014 leading critics to talk of a \u201cGolden Age\u201d of TV. But at the same time, traditional networks have started mimicking film studios and are churning out familiar content to try to catch audiences\u2019 attention. The CW, owned by Time Warner Inc. and CBS Corp. said last month that it would reboot \u201cCharmed,\u201d the Warner Bros. show about a trio of sisters who are powerful witches that first aired in 1998. The show starred Shannen Doherty, Holly Marie Combs, Alyssa Milano and later Rose McGowan. Combs has been vocal on Twitter criticizing the plan to revive the series. Here\u2019s the thing. Until you ask us to rewrite it like Brad Kern did weekly don\u2019t even think of capitalizing on our hard work. Charmed belongs to the 4 of us, our vast amount of writers, crews and predominantly the fans. FYI you will not fool them by owning a title/stamp. So bye. CBS has announced plans to reboot \u201cMurphy Brown,\u201d Walt Disney Co.\u2019s ABC is bringing back \u201cRoseanne\u201d and Comcast Corp.-owned NBC is reviving \u201cThe Office.\u201d    Then there\u2019s \u201cWill & Grace\u201d already airing again on NBC, \u201cMacGyver\u201d on CBS and 21st Century Fox Inc.\u2019s broadcast network brought back \u201cThe X-Files.\u201d Media analyst Barton Crockett notes that tapping into popular old TV shows is a practice that Netflix Inc. has used for years, as it built up its original content library. The streaming giant has revived \u201cArrested Development,\u201d \u201cFull House\u201d and recently brought back \u201cQueer Eye for the Straight Guy,\u201d to name a few. \u201cSuccess begets copy cats. Netflix has seemingly been pretty successful doing this\u201d said Crockett, an analyst at B. Riley FBR. The recent surge in TV reboots has drawn some , who are questioning whether TV executives, like studio execs, have run out of ideas. But it\u2019s not so much about an idea well drying up \u2014 the number of scripted TV shows , up from 455 in 2016. The issue facing networks, rather, is the increased competition from new streaming platforms.       \u201cTV\u2019s not running out of ideas. But because the audience is so overwhelmed with choice, one way that networks \u2014 the traditional broadcast networks in particular \u2014 attempt to cut through the clutter is with familiar brand names,\" said Alan Sepinwall, TV critic and author of \u201cTV (The Book): Two Experts Pick the Greatest American Shows of All Time.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to grab someone\u2019s attention by saying, \u2018\u2018Will & Grace\u2019 is back!\u2019 than by saying, \u2018Here\u2019s a show that in certain ways might remind you of how you once felt about \u2018Will & Grace.\u2019\u201d The recent surge in demand from services like Netflix, Amazon.com Inc. Hulu, and the CBS All Access\u2019s of the world for content has forced networks to leave no stone unturned. Things are bound to get more desperate as Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. toss their deep pocketbooks into the ring. Networks have also looked to tested intellectual property with built-in fan bases to mine new TV series. On Disney\u2019s most recent quarterly conference call, Chief Executive Bob Iger said the company is in the process of developing a few \u201cStar Wars\u201d series for its upcoming streaming service. In 2015 CBS said it would make \u201cStar Trek: Discovery,\u201d now streaming on CBS All Access, and Amazon paid a reported $250 million last year for the rights to make a \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d TV show.    In Hollywood this model has worked to varying degrees of success. On one side are the likes of Disney and its plans for live-action remakes of some of its most popular films. Last year\u2019s \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d was the second highest-grossing film of 2017, and 2016\u2019s \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d grossed $966.6 million worldwide and was well received by critics. The past couple of years have also seen moviegoers reject the Hollywood cycle of reboots, franchises and remakes. The quality of some of these films, like \u201cBen-Hur\u201d in 2016 and \u201cBaywatch\u201d last year, coupled with audiences\u2019 indifference, led to the overall box office underperforming.       The fragmented TV landscape may help audiences overlook the reboot trend. \u201cThere are so many more shows available all over the place that are original titles, whereas the way the movie business runs, your local theater might only have remakes and sequels some weeks,\u201d Sepinwall said. \u201cMost of these [TV] remakes and revivals haven\u2019t worked, but enough of them have that we\u2019re going to keep getting them.\u201d Trey Williams reports for MarketWatch from New York.

{"text": "Published: Tech \u2018may never look the same again,\u2019 S&P warns By The overhaul of the U.S. tax law may be good for tech companies, many of which have kept billions of dollars overseas because of tax rates, but in the long run, it may weaken the credit profile of the sector. In a Thursday report, S&P Global Ratings warned investors that \u201cthe technology sector may never look the same again,\u201d now that the U.S. tax overhaul will allow for tech giants to bring back billions of dollars from overseas coffers. While viewed as an overall positive, it could also result in more fast and loose financial policies that could damage creditworthiness in the sector. Earlier in the week, on signs of weakening earnings. S&P said it believes \u201cthe overall industry credit profile will weaken over time, largely because of the potential for more aggressive financial policies in response to greater access to overseas cash.\u201d Resulting lower cash balances will result in weaker credit metrics ultimately, S&P said, and those aggressive financial policies appear to be key. S&P noted: \u201cIf an issuer adopts a more aggressive financial policy than we expect after repatriation, likely through additional share repurchases, its credit metrics could deteriorate based upon our policy of netting surplus cash against debt, potentially leading to rating or outlook revisions. Generally, we will not deduct surplus cash from debt if a company is (1) owned by a financial sponsor as defined in our criteria, or (2) has a business risk profile at the lower end of the scale (i.e., weak or vulnerable as described in our criteria).\u201d S&P points to \u2019s recent announcement that it plans to go from having and said the tech giant could be a trend setter for the industry.    \u201cWe anticipate that other large cash holders will also announce enhanced shareholder returns over time,\u201d S&P said. Topping that list along with Apple is the only AAA-rated tech issue  along with     and   Then, there are those companies who have as much about as much debt as they have cash to repatriate. Should those companies use the repatriated cash to return to shareholders and still hold on to the debt, that could be harmful to their rating.    S&P noted: Unlike issuers with large net cash positions, we believe those that have both high cash and debt balances face potential credit risks because they may choose to use substantial portions of now-accessible foreign cash for shareholder returns. These issuers, some of which have modest net cash positions or are in net debt positions, will have to manage a delicate balance between equity holders and debtholders. Depletion of cash, if not offset by some debt reduction, can raise leverage by our calculation and lead us to consider a downgrade. S&P used Oracle as an example, pointing out that while it has $72 billion in cash, about 35% of its market cap, it also has $61 billion in debt so its net cash is relatively low, at about 5% of market cap. Other companies in this boat include    and  S&P said. \u201cWe believe companies with these types of balance sheets will have to clarify their financial policies to both equity and bond investors over the coming quarters as cash comes back on shore,\u201d according to S&P. Tech companies that have seen their stocks underperform over the past year or so are particularly vulnerable, because there\u2019s more incentive to return money to shareholders to boost stock prices. S&P said: We are very attentive to the repatriation-related earnings call comments from issuers whose share prices have underperformed the overall market during the past year. Issuers with meaningful cash balances offshore are likely engaged in deep board-level discussions to finalize their capital allocation strategies and we have already heard from some management commenting about \u201creturn of excess capital\u201d to shareholders. We believe that management of companies whose share prices have lagged the market will feel greater pressure to appease the shareholders through aggressive share repurchases or risky acquisitions. One example S&P used was  Over the past 12 months, shares of Juniper have declined 8%, compared with the 15% gain in the S&P 500 index and the 22% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index  On the other hand, companies like  and  which are up 90% and 70%, respectively, over the past 12 months, will have a lot more flexibility with the timing a size of shareholder returns and will likely be better able to balance stock and bondholder needs, S&P said.

{"text": "Published: Bond funds offer no safety from the stock market\u2019s decline By Many average investors are committing a blunder now. It\u2019s not all their fault, though, as information is often dumbed down in the interest of simplicity. As Einstein said: \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler.\u201d Unfortunately, often the information provided to average investors has been simplified below the bare minimum. To avoid the blunder, average investors need a bit of sophistication. To fully understand how to avoid the blunder, let us first start with a chart that illustrates the point. Read on for the blunder and how to avoid it.   Please click for the chart of iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF Please observe the following important points on the chart: \u2022 The chart shows that TLT has fallen about 18% from its recent peak. \u2022 An average investor who bought near the peak to collect about 2.75% interest has now lost about 18% of the principal. \u2022 If interest rates normalize even to the recent low levels, an average investor who bought near the peak will lose 42% of the principal.         Many average investors believe the myth that bonds are safe. There is some truth to the understanding that bonds are safer than stocks, but average investors miss an important nuance. If you buy an individual Treasury bond or a bond of a company with a solid balance sheet and hold it to maturity, you will get your principal back. However, this is not the case when you buy mutual funds or ETFs.   Many average investors are advised to start with 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds. Of course, adjustments are made based on age and objectives. Investors are told that stocks are for growth and bonds are for safety and income. Many average investors do not understand that they can lose a lot of money in bonds.   Bonds have been in a 30-year bull market. For this reason, the bad advice given to investors has not hurt them so far. However, average investors need to know that the bull market has ended.   As stock market volatility has risen, many average investors who want safety are moving out of stocks into bonds. They are doing so because they do not understand the following: \u2022 They can lose money in bonds, as illustrated in the chart linked above. \u2022 Interest rates are rising. \u2022 Bonds move inverse to interest rates. In plain English, when interest rates go higher, bonds go lower. \u2022 Stocks are experiencing volatility because of rising interest rates.   First and foremost, do not buy bond funds or ETFs. Second, understand that most funds and popular ETFs are concentrated in a handful of stocks that have run up and now pose a high risk. For example, the top holdings of popular ETF are Apple Microsoft and Facebook Alphabet  is right there too. These are also the top holdings of popular ETF along with Nvidia Netflix and Qualcomm  The point is that many investors are overly concentrated in technology stocks.

{"text": "Published: Companies are unlikely to use much of the savings to permanently reduce debt, and most will spend it on shareholders By The will likely lead to as many ratings downgrades as upgrades, as companies will spend most of the savings on shareholder returns or mergers and acquisitions, S&P Global Ratings said Thursday. While corporate borrowers are still working to evaluate the full impact on their business, S&P is not expecting them to use much of the extra cash to permanently reduce debt, leaving leverage tolerance levels unchanged.    \u201cAs a result, we believe reform-related ratings changes of more than one notch will be rare, and upgrades and downgrades are both equally likely,\u201d said analysts led by Michael Altberg and David Tesher in a new report. \u201cWhile some upgrades will stem from sustained improvements in credit metrics, downgrades could result from either the direct negative effects of tax reform or shifts in financial policy.\u201d       The main beneficiaries of the tax revamp are investment-grade issuers, those rated at BBB-minus or higher, and crossover credits, or those with ratings that span the investment and speculative grades. Most of those are unlikely to make significant changes to their leverage-tolerance levels in an effort to get a higher rating, said the report.       It cited as an example Comcast Corp.\u2019s recent statement that it would keep leverage at about 2.2 times instead of lowering it. \u201cSimilarly, we expect Apple Inc.\u2019s use of its roughly $163 billion of surplus cash balances to be heavily skewed toward share repurchases,\u201d said the report.       Companies with less optimal capital structures \u2014 such as high-yield issuers, or those rated BB-plus and lower \u2014 may pursue debt repayment and deleveraging more enthusiastically, but S&P is not expecting major changes to capital structures. \u201cMore likely, issuers will make incremental adjustments, especially when deciding how to address interest-deductibility caps,\u201d said the report. Still, the credit implications vary across sectors with those that have traditionally had higher effective tax rates \u2014 media and entertainment, business services and health-care companies \u2014 expected to benefit most from the drop in the statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. For regulated utilities, the lower tax rate is a credit negative, as they will be pressured to pass the savings on to customers. Other sectors will not benefit much as they have historically made good use of deductions and deferrals that allowed them to pay way less than the 35% rate. The provision that limits interest deductibility is a clear negative, but may have a more subdued credit impact than originally feared, said the report.    \u201cWithin the oil and gas sector, for example, we expect tax reform to have a low impact due to the extensive net operating losses [that] many issuers have accrued over the last few years,\u201d said the report. The limits are expected to apply to about half of S&P\u2019s speculative-grade universe, but many of these highly leveraged issuers, especially those that have gone through leveraged buyouts, don\u2019t pay taxes. Those companies may more quickly exhaust net operating losses, however. The repatriation tax and shift to a territorial tax system will mostly impact those sectors with large overseas cash balances, notably technology companies, like Apple, and companies in health-care-related businesses that used tax inversions to lower their tax bills. Apple shares have gained 22% in the last 12 months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 22.5% and the S&P 500 has gained 15%. S&P is expecting those companies to permanently reduce their cash position over time. Apple has already said it would seek to become net cash neutral. \u201cThis could fundamentally alter the landscape of these sectors and lead to weaker liquidity, less-flexible balance sheets, and tighter cushions against downgrade thresholds over time,\u201d said S&P. Other possible secondary affects include shifts in financial policy, if companies come under pressure from activists to return more cash to shareholders. Some issuers may seek to issue debt in high-tax foreign jurisdictions that still allow interest deductibility, a move that could have a knock-on effect on existing debt instruments, depending on how much money is raised \u201cUltimately, domestic unsecured borrowings are more likely to be harmed than helped by increased foreign borrowings,\u201d said the report.    Moody\u2019s Investors Service said last month that it does not expect the tax bill to have much impact on the economy, also predicting that companies would use savings to reward shareholders, while the income-tax cut for the wealthy will not trickle down.
