In a Thursday report, S&P Global Ratings warned investors that \u201cthe technology sector may never look the same again,\u201d now that the U.S. tax overhaul will allow for tech giants to bring back billions of dollars from overseas coffers. While viewed as an overall positive, it could also result in more fast and loose financial policies that could damage creditworthiness in the sector. Earlier in the week, on signs of weakening earnings. S&P said it believes \u201cthe overall industry credit profile will weaken over time, largely because of the potential for more aggressive financial policies in response to greater access to overseas cash.\u201d Resulting lower cash balances will result in weaker credit metrics ultimately, S&P said, and those aggressive financial policies appear to be key. S&P noted: \u201cIf an issuer adopts a more aggressive financial policy than we expect after repatriation, likely through additional share repurchases, its credit metrics could deteriorate based upon our policy of netting surplus cash against debt, potentially leading to rating or outlook revisions. Generally, we will not deduct surplus cash from debt if a company is (1) owned by a financial sponsor as defined in our criteria, or (2) has a business risk profile at the lower end of the scale (i.e., weak or vulnerable as described in our criteria).\u201d S&P points to \u2019s recent announcement that it plans to go from having and said the tech giant could be a trend setter for the industry.    \u201cWe anticipate that other large cash holders will also announce enhanced shareholder returns over time,\u201d S&P said. Topping that list along with Apple is the only AAA-rated tech issue  along with     and   Then, there are those companies who have as much about as much debt as they have cash to repatriate. Should those companies use the repatriated cash to return to shareholders and still hold on to the debt, that could be harmful to their rating.    S&P noted: Unlike issuers with large net cash positions, we believe those that have both high cash and debt balances face potential credit risks because they may choose to use substantial portions of now-accessible foreign cash for shareholder returns. These issuers, some of which have modest net cash positions or are in net debt positions, will have to manage a delicate balance between equity holders and debtholders. Depletion of cash, if not offset by some debt reduction, can raise leverage by our calculation and lead us to consider a downgrade. S&P used Oracle as an example, pointing out that while it has $72 billion in cash, about 35% of its market cap, it also has $61 billion in debt so its net cash is relatively low, at about 5% of market cap. Other companies in this boat include    and  S&P said. \u201cWe believe companies with these types of balance sheets will have to clarify their financial policies to both equity and bond investors over the coming quarters as cash comes back on shore,\u201d according to S&P. Tech companies that have seen their stocks underperform over the past year or so are particularly vulnerable, because there\u2019s more incentive to return money to shareholders to boost stock prices. S&P said: We are very attentive to the repatriation-related earnings call comments from issuers whose share prices have underperformed the overall market during the past year. Issuers with meaningful cash balances offshore are likely engaged in deep board-level discussions to finalize their capital allocation strategies and we have already heard from some management commenting about \u201creturn of excess capital\u201d to shareholders. We believe that management of companies whose share prices have lagged the market will feel greater pressure to appease the shareholders through aggressive share repurchases or risky acquisitions. One example S&P used was  Over the past 12 months, shares of Juniper have declined 8%, compared with the 15% gain in the S&P 500 index and the 22% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index  On the other hand, companies like  and  which are up 90% and 70%, respectively, over the past 12 months, will have a lot more flexibility with the timing a size of shareholder returns and will likely be better able to balance stock and bondholder needs, S&P said.

HomePod can turn on \n      the lights, raise the shades, set the desired temperature or make other \n      adjustments and serves as the perfect home hub, enabling remote access \n      and automations.   Through SiriKit\u2122, HomePod supports third-party messaging apps, so users \n      can ask Siri to send a message to a friend or colleague using apps like \n      WhatsApp. Reminders, note-taking and to-do list apps like Things and \n      Evernote will automatically work with HomePod, so Siri can set \n      reminders, create a new list, mark items as complete, or create and \n      modify notes. For developers interested in adding SiriKit support, more \n      information is available at .   Coming this year in a free software update, users will be able to play \n      music throughout the house with multi-room audio.

If there's more than one \n      HomePod set up in the same room, the speakers can be set up as a stereo \n      pair for an even more immersive sound experience.   Security and privacy are fundamental to the design of Apple hardware, \n      software and services. With HomePod, only after \u201cHey Siri\u201d is recognized \n      locally on the device will any information be sent to Apple servers, \n      encrypted and sent using an anonymous Siri identifier.

{"link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/fintech-stocks-to-bring-us-mobile-payment-market-to-nearly-3-trillion-by-2020-2018-01-24", "source": "https://www.marketwatch.com/", "text": "Published: LOS ANGELES, January 24, 2018 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ --\nLOS ANGELES, January 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --     - Used for all types of operations, like merchandise payments, ticketing, money transfers, and bill payments, US mobile payment transactions are now projected to reach a value USD$2.849 trillion in the year 2020- . The sky-high potential of this market is well known already to many FinTech investors, and development companies in the sector that includes  (cse:GET),    and   The study, which used 2015 numbers (USD$550 billion) as the base year for analysis, expects a whopping CAGR of 39.1% through to 2020, . In terms of use widespread use of mobile payments, China far outdoes the US, at more than 50 times the current usage. Already, -so Western developers and marketers can see what is a possibility down the road. Widespread acceptance in China of major mobile payment platforms has led to major gains from developers of platforms such as Alipay from (BABA) and TenPay from (TCEHY)-which hold a 54% and 37% market share, respectively. In North America, however, though the market is already above USD$550 billion, there is still plenty of growth expected that will come with the adoption of easy-to-use mobile payment apps. Such apps that are changing the way we pay for everything from toys to avocado toast, include Google Wallet from  Apple Pay from  Samsung Pay from  and the fast-rising restaurant app Glance Pay from (OTC: ) (CSE: ).   Possibly the fastest moving of any sector in North America, in terms of sheer number of transactions, is that of the food industry. After the rollout of fast food brand Subway's stores with self-ordering kiosks that feature support for mobile payments, a survey was done to determine how many fast food eaters use mobile payments. According to the survey, it was found that had used mobile payment services in the prior month. Much of that comes from Asia Pacific markets, where 51% of respondents said they had used their phones to pay the bill in the month before. Those included the trialed use of \"smile to pay\" , supported by Alibaba's Ant Financial affiliate. While lower in comparison to their Asian counterparts, fast food eaters in Europe (32%) and North America (26%) are a consumer base that's higher than average in their respective regions for paying via mobile. Therefore, a more wide-scale adoption can be expected to come through the food industry, perhaps faster than through big-box retail stores, such as Walmart and Target which have also recently launched mobile payment apps for their respective chains. One company that is looking to corner the market on mobile payments in North American restaurants, is (OTC: ) (CSE: )-developers of the popular and secure app Glance Pay.   Diners are becoming more accustomed to using an app to improve their dining experience-whether it's . Convenience is key, and time is precious for eat-in diners-especially during the noon-day lunch hour, when no one wants to be busted returning late to back to work. Restaurant owners also want to , resulting in higher revenues during their establishment's prime times. The more diners they can serve in an hour, the higher the likelihood that their eateries will survive. In an effort to shave valuable minutes off of everyone's least favorite part of the dining experience (paying the bill), Glance Pay from Vancouver-based developers,  (cse:GET) is improving the dining experience for customers across North America. Streamlined and designed to revolutionize how we dine, Glance Pay is a mobile payment platform helping users choose where to dine, order goods and services, make payments, access digital receipts, redeem digital deals, earn great rewards & interact with merchants. Easy to use for both diners, and restauranteurs, Glance Pay is spreading wide across its home country of Canada and soon into the US and Europe in the near future. Already, popular chains and independent restaurants are adopting Glance Pay, including Ricky's Restaurant Group with almost 150 locations in Canada, and Canada with 52 locations across the country. Seeing Glance Pay as a brand leader-or potential Uber, or AirBnB of the restaurant industry- often ranked as InsTech's #1 FinTech Influencer in the world, joined the Advisory Board of Glance Technologies. \"I'm in love with Glance's simplicity and arena of business. In some ways it's like Uber, in terms of convenience. However, I think that its placement in the restaurant business is something that could turn into a huge success story,\" said Margaris upon the . At the time of Margaris's addition to the team in late September, Glance's stock was trading at $0.375-Since then, the stock has hit a 52-week high of $3.20. \"If they can replicate what they've already done in Canada, in the US and worldwide, it'll be a billion-dollar company,\" added Margaris. \"If it enters a major US centre at the beginning of next year, and executes in a popular state such as New York, I can see a $5 share price. The sky's the limit.\" In addition to Glance Pay's ease of use, it's the app's stellar security record that has further driven its widespread acceptance. As of November, Glance Technologies officially announced its fraud on the app. Further improving upon its anti-fraud expertise, Glance Pay has introduced its own cryptocurrency which corresponds with the app's built-in customer loyalty incentives for both the restaurants and the app itself. Much like the addition of Margaris, Glance brought in more expertise, through the , Dinis Guarda to the Advisory Board. Along with the appointment, Glance acquired Guarda's company Ztudium's cryptocurrency technology, . Much like the majors and their platforms, such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay etc., Glance Pay is gaining momentum across multiple outlets, in many sectors. However, its strongest sector remains in the food industry. Unlike for Apple, Google, and Samsung, investors in Glance Technologies still have plenty of blue-sky to look forward to, as they build out the brand either to market dominance, or being bought out by a major.      Alphabet Inc., more popularly known as Google, provides global online advertising services, as well as performance and brand advertising services. The Google segment includes principal Internet products, such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, Android, Chrome, Wallet and Google Play, as well as technical infrastructure and newer efforts, including Virtual Reality. Google Wallet is an encrypted app meant for peer to peer transactions. Alphabet Inc. was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Mountain View, California.    Apple designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise, and government customers worldwide. Apple's Apple Pay is the company's contactless payment system for mobile phones, launched in 2014, and growing in popularity. Apple Pay is now available in millions of stores, like Nike, Ulta, and can be used online and in other apps and websites such as Airbnb and Lululemon.    Samsung together with its subsidiaries engages in the consumer electronics, information technology and mobile communications, and device solutions businesses worldwide. The company provides mobile payment and communication system services, as well as manufactures and sells server semiconductor storage system. Samsung's mobile payment system, Samsung Pay, is designed to replace the plastic cards in your wallet. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. was founded in 1938 and is based in Suwon, South Korea.

The feature was initially announced last year at the company's Worldwide Developer Conference and will launch with partners that include Wells Fargo and Discover.

According to the Nikkei report, which cited unnamed supply-chain sources, \"Apple will halve its production target for the iPhone X in the three-month period from January from the figure of over 40 million units envisaged at the time of its release in November.

Considering that this is a 17% premium from this past Friday's closing price, it had traders pretty excited.

He wrote, \"While there is certainly a bullish sentiment surrounding the stock, we think that many investors still underestimate the Netflix story particularly with respect to the penetration opportunity around the world.

In addition to a visual overlay, AR may also provide audio and tactile inputs to the user, and rely upon presence and positioning technologies to present location-specific sensory inputs and information to the user. In this manner, AR represents a blending of information technology and media within a real-world environment for the benefit of consumer, business, and industrial users.    Download the full report:     The term Mixed Reality (MR) pertains to a form of hybrid reality in which physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real-time. With MR, either virtual objects are digitally mixed into reality or real-world objects are merged into virtual worlds. The latter case is sometimes referred to as Augmented Virtuality (AV), and is one step closer to Virtual Reality (VR), as real-world objects in a virtual world take on a sense of permanency with real objects, appearing to actually exist within the virtual world.  Adding to this sense of permanency, real-world objects in a virtual world may be digitally controlled. Conversely, MR may also support manipulation of virtual objects permanently placed in the real-world. In either scenario, MR will be an important aspect of teleoperation and tele-robotics.  The primary goal of AR is to enrich the user's perception of the real-world, providing information and insights that otherwise would not be obtainable. AR use cases have grown substantially across many industry verticals within the last two years, providing significant market momentum, and indicating great promise to transform communications, content, and commerce across a wide range of sectors. The goals of MR are broad, yet directionally focused on a true merging of real and virtual worlds, which Mind Commerce believes will be a major catalyst for wide-spread acceptance and usage of VR across all major industry sectors.

A recent article on PYMNTS.com, PayPal's \"Global Freelancer Insights Report\" found that mobile is an important tool for freelancers, while security is also top of mind. In a corporate blog post detailing the results,  said mobile payments, mobile apps and mobile communication are important tools for freelancers, with those surveyed noting mobile tools and the ability to invoice and receive payments on mobile devices is crucial for them. Additionally, PayPal said security is a big concern for freelancers, with 47 percent of those surveyed saying security is an important factor when choosing a payment method. While PayPal's survey found freelancers to be optimistic about their futures, they did admit an irregular income is their biggest challenge. Of the survey respondents, the majority of freelancers around the world expect business to grow in the future, with strong growth expected from those residing in Vietnam, India, the Philippines, Mexico and Argentina. At the same time, more than 50 percent of freelancers polled in Hong Kong, Russia and South Africa said irregular payments are an issue.

The partnership with  was announced in a statement on Wednesday by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, which runs Alipay. Apple's regional China website, iTunes Store, and App Store have accepted Alipay for over a year, but Apple has now agreed to accept Alipay payments across all of its 41 local retail stores in the country, where Apple Pay has thus far received a lukewarm reception.

But it looks like they shied away from many of the most shorted stocks traded on the Nasdaq between the January 12 and January 31 settlement dates. The short sellers of Cisco, Comcast and Mattel may have had the right idea, in that they piled on these stocks during the latter weeks of last month. Otherwise, the short interest in the most shorted Nasdaq stocks dwindled during the period. Note that still just three Nasdaq stocks had more than 100 million shares short as of the most recent settlement date. The more than 216.10 million Sirius XM Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: SIRI) shares short after the final two weeks of last month represented a decline of more than 15 million from the previous settlement date. The latest reading totaled 15.2% of the available float. Though the average daily volume retreated in the period, the days to cover remained less than nine. At least one analyst has boosted its target price on Sirius XM recently. The stock ended the short interest period more than 11% higher than where it began it. The Nasdaq saw about a 1% gain between the settlement dates. Like the broader markets, Sirius has retreated some in the past week. Its shares closed most recently at $5.82 apiece. That is less than the 52-week high of $6.28 seen last month. The 52-week low of $4.69 was reached about a year ago. By the end of January, Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) had almost 164.59 million shares short. That was down more than 6% from the total on the previous settlement date, and it was the lowest level of short interest since October. The latest reading represented 18.3% of the company's float. The average daily volume shrank in that time, but the number of days it would take to cover all short positions remained less than three. AMD posted strong quarterly results at the end of the short interest period. Its January 31 closing share price was more than 14% higher than on the previous settlement date, though it has retreated more than that since then. The stock closed trading on Friday at $11.31 a share, which is still about 3% higher year to date. Shares have changed hands at between $9.70 and $15.65 apiece in the past year. More than 104.76 million Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) shares were sold short as of the most recent settlement date. The figure shrank by more than 1% in the period to the smallest reading since last August. The most recent figure represented 2.2% of the company's float. As of the end of last month, it still would take about more than two days for investors to cover all short positions. Analysts were generally pleased with Intel\u2019s most recent quarterly results. Yet the stock ended the short interest period more than 6% lower, though it was down more than 8% at one point during those two weeks. Intel closed most recently at $43.95 a share, which is down from a 52-week high of $50.85 at the end of January. The 52-week low is $33.23. The share price now is more than 6% lower year to date. Comcast Corp.'s (NASDAQ: CMCSA) short interest jumped almost 34% from in the previous period to more than 86.19 million shares on the most recent settlement date. That was the highest number of shares short in at least a year, and it represented 1.9% of the total float. However, the days to cover figure remained more than three as the average daily volume rose somewhat. Comcast has been recognized as one of the most hated companies in America. While its share price ended the two-week period about where it began it, it was more than 2% higher at one point in the interval. The stock retreated more than 6% in the past week and closed most recently at $38.57. That is only down about 5% in the past six months. The 52-week trading range is $34.78 to $44.00. Short interest in Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: SGYP) totaled over 76.50 million shares by the end of January, after a pullback of nearly 4 million from the prior settlement date. Still, that represented a whopping 31.1% of the total float, and it was the sixth consecutive period with more than 70 million shares short. The days to cover shrank from less than 12 to more than eight during the latest period as the average daily volume grew. This biopharmaceutical company is focused on treatments for constipation and irritable bowel syndrome. Short sellers watched the stock climb about 16%, fall more than 16% into the red, but then end those two weeks down only about 8%. The most recent closing share price was $1.97, which is more than 19% lower year to date. The shares have changed hands between $1.68 and $6.45 apiece in the past year. The number of Mattel Inc. (NASDAQ: MAT) shares short totaled almost 60.49 million on the latest settlement date. That was up more than 9% from two weeks earlier to the highest level since November, and it represented 17.7% of the total float. The average daily trading volume grew as well, and the days to cover figure dropped from almost 14 to more than eight. During the period, Mattel posted disappointing results, despite strong Barbie brand numbers. By the end of the short interest period, the share price was more than 5% higher, though it was up by about 24% at one point. The stock ended this past Friday\u2019s trading at $17.27 a share, in a 52-week range of $12.71 to $26.30. The share price currently is almost 8% higher than it was six months ago. Rounding out the top 10 were Cisco Systems Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO), Micron Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: MU), Opko Health Inc. (NASDAQ: OPK) and TherapeuticsMD Inc. (NASDAQ: TXMD). The only gainer here was Cisco, with a surge of more than 21% in its short interest. Micron saw a double-digit percentage decline in the number of its shares short, and it slipped out of the top six. Note that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) moved further out of the top 10 with a notable shrinkage in its short interest in the most recent period. But lingering outside the spotlight of the top 10 most shorted Nasdaq stocks were Groupon Inc. (NASDAQ: GRPN) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT).

Yes, the Model 3. Tesla is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results after the bell on Wednesday, and investors are sure to parse every word the company utters about the Model 3 production ramp. \u201cOur concern has been really the same since September,\u201d said David Kudla, Chief Executive of Mainstay Capital Management. \u201cIt\u2019s the Model 3 and production delays that continue to be delayed even further. Are they going to delay again, or are they going to make progress?\u201d Tesla recently filed to do its first asset-backed securities deal, and the company has moved to quash renewed concerns about its production.    Meanwhile, its stock performance continues to outperform benchmarks and competitors, even though the company is expected to report a wider loss for the quarter. Tesla shorts, or those investors betting the stock will turn lower, have lost about $1.3 billion so far this year, according to recent data from financial analytics firm S3.       Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Tesla to report an adjusted loss of $3.11 a share in the quarter, compared with an adjusted loss of 69 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Estimize, a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from Wall Street analysts as well as buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, company executives, academics and others, has also projected an adjusted loss of $3.11 a share.  The FactSet revenue consensus is $3.3 billion, which would be up from $2.3 billion in the same quarter last year. Estimize has the same consensus.  Tesla\u2019s stock has gained more than 35% in the past 12 months, which compares with gains of around 20% for the S&P 500 index and 26% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  It also leaves in the dust the stock of competitor General Motors Co. which has gained 13% in the same period. Tesla stock gains contrast with losses of more than 15% for Ford Motor Co. stock.       Chief Executive Elon Musk has taken to twitter to , the company he started with the aim of boring underground tunnels to ease traffic congestion: Flamethrowers. \u201cI\u2019m the first to admit Musk is a genius,\u201d but it is unclear whether making money is his goal for Tesla, Mainstay\u2019s Kudla said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with the manufacturing process,\u201d he said, adding that he has shorted Tesla in the past year and made profits. There will always be people who love Tesla like they love Apple Inc. and will give the company and its CEO pass after pass but for its products and cachet. But ultimately, the company has to make money to be taken seriously,\u201d he said. Tesla and Musk recently , including growing to a market capitalization of $650 billion, more than 10 times the company\u2019s current market value. The announcement could have alleviated \u201crising concerns over key man risk,\u201d analysts at Nomura said in a recent note, as the new plan requires Musk to remain CEO or serve as both executive chairman and chief product officer in order for stock-vesting schedules to trigger. Tesla in early January That goal post, first set for 2017, then for the first quarter of 2018, has been moved to the second quarter of the year. The fourth-quarter report will be a \u201cde-risking event\u201d as Model 3 production continues to ramp, analysts at Baird said in a note Tuesday. \u201cWe are buyers ahead of (fourth-quarter results,\u201d they said. \u201cWe believe (Tesla\u2019s) recent decision to push out production targets has de-risked the stock, and the Q4 report could remove another overhang. Positive reviews of the Model 3 are likely to coincide with more deliveries to non-employees, which should strengthen demand and drive company shares higher, the analysts said. Tesla can fund the Model 3 ramp without raising additional capital, but a capital raise would remove an additional overhang, they said. Baird analysts updated their calls for 2018, saying they expect an adjusted loss of $1.57 a share for the year, which compares with FactSet consensus for an adjusted loss of $4.16.

By Soldiers using fitness tracking devices inadvertently revealed the locations of U.S. military bases \u2014 including classified ones \u2014 and the incident has lessons for anyone with a smartphone. The locations of several U.S. military bases through data from Strava, a San Francisco-based GPS tracking company, representing a \u201cclear security threat,\u201d according to one security analyst, the Washington Post reported. The Strava app is used with phones and popular devices like Jawbone, Fitbit and Vitofit. Its public \u201cheat maps,\u201d which show where there is high concentration of activity, revealed locations where troops were using it to train in Somalia, Niger, Syria and Afghanistan. Military bases aren\u2019t the only locations at risk of being exposed, a Feb. 7 study from mobile security firm found. It showed a security flaw in Strava\u2019s privacy zone feature that can triangulate the exact home address of users. Strava\u2019s \u201cprivacy zone\u201d tool lets users stop the app from tracking their activities around a specific address, presumably their home or workplace. Wandera researchers found that it\u2019s possible to triangulate the exact location of a person\u2019s address using the end points of users\u2019 activities. Strava did respond to requests for comment regarding either of these security breaches. These issues have underscored the importance of companies clearly explaining to consumers what data is shared on apps, said Mark Testoni, chief executive officer and president of in Virginia. He said there should be labels on apps regarding privacy, similar to nutritional labels on food.    Fitness tracking companies can pinpoint where people live, how often they sleep, and even when they are engaged in sexual activity based on data collected, said Mark Weinstein, a privacy advocate and chief executive officer of social network . Allowing apps to access photos is perhaps the most egregious permission, said George Avetisov, chief executive officer at HYPR, a security company . Apps use facial recognition technology and, in theory, can track you and who you spend time with. Case in point: Uber\u2019s \u201cGod view\u201d display the movements of specific users. The company reportedly used the tool as a \u201cparty trick,\u201d showing guests at a launch party a screen that showed all rides happening at a given time. An Uber executive also admitted to tracking the rider logs of a BuzzFeed News reporter. following these reports, the company a $20,000 fine. Testoni said there should be labels on apps regarding privacy, similar to nutritional labels on food. \u201cWe do not want to put people in harm\u2019s way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to look at this through a public policy perspective and make consumers more aware of the data being collected on us daily.\u201d Such a measure could be far away, experts say. In April 2017, Congress approved a reversal of protections implemented under the Obama administration that prevented internet service providers from collecting data from users. Now, corporations are to track user habits. Here are some measures to minimize risk of sharing sensitive information:   If you gloss over terms of service after downloading an app, you aren\u2019t alone: 91% of users accept legal terms and conditions without reading them, one from U.K. tax services company Deloitte found. This is a dangerous habit and an easy way to sign away your privacy, Weinstein said. \u201cScan them and look for things that jump out like location services,\u201d he said.   Within the terms of service on apps \u2014 often on a separate prompt screen \u2014 companies ask users permission to access features beyond location, including microphone, photos, camera, and contacts. Weinstein said to deny access to as many of these as possible, especially if the app is from a small or unknown company. Some apps allow users to enable microphone and other features only while using it, which decreases the amount of data collected at other times. That would be a wise move, Avetisov said. \u201cAre these apps pulling this data maliciously? The truth is that most app users are allowing this data to be used the moment that approve the app\u2019s permission settings,\u201d he said.   Although convenient, signing into apps with existing accounts on Google or Facebook puts users at higher risk for hacking and provides more data to those companies to track and sell, Mark Weinstein said. Make a separate log in and password for every single account, and use a password manager to keep track of them.   If you\u2019re not using your app to hail a ride or find a restaurant, consider turning off location settings completely. On Apple devices, users can go to \u201csettings,\u201d \u201cprivacy.\u201d It will cut down on tracking and save battery power. For Android devices, \u201d \u201clocation,\u201d \u201cGoogle location settings.\u201d That simple maneuver would have helped those U.S. military personnel protect their location.

{"link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/qualcomm-5g-devices-are-coming-in-2019-leaving-apple-behind-2018-02-08", "source": "https://www.marketwatch.com/", "text": "Published: To maintain a leadership role, Qualcomm forges partnerships with 18 companies By Qualcomm, under pressure to show value and growth amid a looming hostile takeover bid from Broadcom, is hoping that its position in the market for next-generation cellular-radio technology will be a foundation of its future. The company revealed today partnerships with 18 global original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that will be launching 5G-ready devices in 2019. A total of 18 worldwide cellular carriers will be completing tests of Qualcomm 5G radios in 2018. 5G is the follow-up iteration to the current 4G cellular technology in most of the world\u2019s smartphones. It will improve the speed of connectivity, lower latency and transform markets from self-driving cars to industrial automation. And it can do all of this while lowering the load on carrier networks, giving all users a noticeable increase in performance and usability. Qualcomm has been leaning on this 4G-to-5G transition as a portion of its long-term plan and strategy for many years. As a part of the company\u2019s recent call to action for shareholders to  the San Diego-based company believes that it has a 12- to 24-month lead over competing connectivity providers, namely Intel This position will allow Qualcomm to capitalize on what many believe could be the most disruptive and market-shifting wireless transition in history. To maintain a leadership role, despite mass-market availability being limited to 2019 products, Qualcomm has announced partnerships with 18 OEMs that will build those products using the Snapdragon X50 modem. The modem was the first announced to support the finalized specification of 5G radios. OEMs like LG, HTC, Sony, Asus and Vivo are committed to using the X50 modem in devices ranging from next-generation smartphones to Windows-based PCs. There has been talk that 5G products would not be available until 2020, but Qualcomm believes that 5G will have an impact on revenue a year earlier than that. This collection of phone and device providers puts Qualcomm well ahead of Intel in terms of integration and support in the market, something Qualcomm has believed would be the case but is only now finally confirmed. Commercialization of 5G and collaborations with the leading device manufacturers will push Intel further back in the race, with time running out for it to catch up. Two big OEMs are missing from the list in Qualcomm\u2019s announcement: Samsung and Apple While it makes sense that Apple would not want to be included in the public statements from Qualcomm considering the legal dispute between the two companies, there is a legitimate question as to whether Apple will be an early adopter of 5G technology at all. It has shown in the past that it is more than willing to let others experiment and drive wireless technology shifts on the networks, with both the iPhone 3G and first iPhone with LTE (iPhone 5) lagging behind other smartphones by several quarters. If Apple chooses to not integrate the Qualcomm modem, it will depend on Intel to provide a product instead, and could miss out on 5G technology for all of 2019. Not seeing Samsung as a part of this announcement from Qualcomm is more surprising, but likely an omission of politics than of technology. I recently wrote about the extension and expansion of the licensing and it is unlikely that this contract would not have included the X50 modem for 5G. I expect the 2019 models of Samsung\u2019s Galaxy devices to include the Qualcomm chip as well. The second part to this story is that 18 global cellular carriers, including Verizon and AT&T in the U.S., China Mobile and SK Telecom will be testing 5G with Qualcomm devices and infrastructure in 2018. These validation tests are used to demonstrate the capabilities of new wireless technology and finalize the implementation methods for the hardware in the field. These two announcements put Qualcomm in the driver\u2019s seat for 5G adoption and integration. 5G will offer consumers speeds that are up to five times faster than today\u2019s top offerings, lower latency for more responsive web browsing and new capabilities like streaming virtual reality. It will make Wi-Fi less necessary. The cellular carriers will take advantage of 5G for its ability to run more data through existing infrastructure, opening capacity for more users, devices and upgradable services.

Since then, similar allegations have brought down numerous men in the entertainment industry, from to \u201cToday\u201d anchor . This trend has not left corporate America unscathed. Even before the Weinstein allegations came to light, claims of sexual harassment . More recently, Wynn Resorts Ltd. Chief Executive and Chairman Steve Wynn after facing scrutiny of pressuring female employees to perform sex acts. Those claims have prompted investigations by gaming regulators in Massachusetts and Nevada. The Massachusetts Gaming Commission revealed that Wynn Resorts paid to a woman who claimed that Steve Wynn forced her to have sex with him.    The way in which Wynn Resorts handled the sexual-assault allegations lobbed at its founder is not atypical of corporate America. Many companies follow similar protocols in mediating such disputes, said Brian Kropp, who leads the human-resources practice at the consulting firm Gartner. \u201cWith some companies, their playbook on how to respond to claims of sexual harassment is 30 years old,\u201d Kropp said. To this day, many companies will handle such allegations by having human resources perform an internal investigation. If the claims look to be true, the victim will get some sort of financial payout, while the harasser will be reprimanded \u2014 or fired, if the allegations are particularly egregious. However, the deliberations are for the most part kept under wraps. \u201cThey want to minimize risk and exposure for the company,\u201d Kropp said. \u201cThat mind-set still permeates how a lot of organizations are approaching sexual harassment today.\u201d Some companies have chosen a newer approach \u2014 one that gets to the core of the company\u2019s culture. In these instances, the companies are instilling a sense of equity across the organization. That includes measures that ensure equal pay and efforts to promote more women and people from other underrepresented groups, Kropp said. \u201cIt\u2019s thinking about all the systems within a company that create a perception of unfairness,\u201d he said. \u201cSo rather than trying to manage risk, they are creating a culture where it\u2019s not allowed.\u201d A recent study from hiring firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas found that felt compelled to re-evaluate their sexual harassment policies in light of the #MeToo movement. Of those, only 25% chose to update their guidelines.    So what decisions to this end are being made in the boardrooms of the 30 companies that form the Dow Jones Industrial Average ? It\u2019s tough to say. MarketWatch reached out to all 30 companies, asking them to comment on whether they\u2019ve updated their policies related to sexual-harassment claims in light of recent events. Only 10 of those companies provided comment. The lack of response shouldn\u2019t be surprising though, Kropp said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to respond to questions about what they do or don\u2019t do because every response that\u2019s out there is discoverable if a lawsuit occurs,\u201d he said. Here is what the companies that have responded have had to say:     said that any inappropriate behavior that violates the company\u2019s goals related to mutual respect will not be tolerated, even if the actions aren\u2019t illegal. \u201cEmployees at every level are required to report any behavior that would interfere with a fair and respectful workplace, and complaints are investigated promptly,\u201d the company said. Employee concerns can be raised to leadership and human resources or through 3M\u2019s reporting system, which provides the option to remain anonymous.     said that sexual harassment in the workplace isn\u2019t tolerated and that reports of sexual harassment are investigated. The company further reviews policies relating to harassment \u201cin a timely manner and update them as needed,\u201d it said.     said it continuously looks at its already strong policies, with every allegation vigorously investigated. The company\u2019s indicate that Apple will not \u201ctolerate discrimination or harassment of employees or non-employees with whom we have a business, service, or professional relationship.\u201d     described itself as \u201ca values-based company\u201d in a statement. The company trains all employees on its code of conduct, which includes \u201crobust anti-harassment policies,\u201d on an annual basis, it said.     said it focuses on corporate culture as part of its approach to addressing concerns surround misconduct. \u201cWe believe that preventing sexual harassment is not just a matter of having sound policies, but having a culture in which employees are comfortable bringing their concerns forward and calling out inappropriate behavior when and if it occurs,\u201d Cisco said. \u201cOur focus is on ensuring that all Cisco employees are cognizant of the power dynamics and are committed to fostering an environment in which every employee is heard, valued and is in a position to be their best at work.\u201d The company added that it \u201cunequivocally\u201d prohibited harassment and discrimination through its code of conduct and harassment prevention policies.     has not updated policies related to sexual harassment in reaction to recent events, but a company spokesman said that the company reviews and updates policies \u201calmost annually\u201d to meet changes in the law and in best practices. \u201cWe reissued our policy recently as part of our standard practice. In light of recent events,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cWe also reminded all employees of our policy and of our leadership\u2019s commitment to that policy.\u201d     said it does not tolerate sexual harassment. The company has open reporting channels and encourages employees to come forward through them if they have been subject to inappropriate conduct. Those allegations are then \u201cimpartially investigated,\u201d and \u201cswift disciplinary action\u201d will occur as needed. The company\u2019s general counsel recently sent a memo to all employees reiterating the company\u2019s zero-tolerance policy and its transparency in handling these matters.     also said it has a zero-tolerance policy for \u201canyone who violates our value of respect for all people,\u201d a company spokesman said. Home Depot maintains an open-door policy to encourage anyone to report incidents of harassment, which is backed up with regular training, according to the company.     was yet another company that said it has a \u201czero-tolerance policy when it comes to sexual harassment.\u201d Managers, it said, are required to complete annual training.   . referred to Chief Executive Jamie Dimon\u2019s note to employees in June in which he wrote that employees should not refrain from reporting any unethical conduct. \u201cIf you see something wrong \u2014 or think it isn\u2019t right \u2014 say something,\u201d Dimon wrote. \u201cRaise the issue and report it. We rely on your personal integrity to protect and enhance the firm\u2019s reputation.\u201d    didn\u2019t offer a formal response, but the company has recently reissued its code of ethics. In a letter to employees, Chief Executive Gregory Hayes said that central to the code is a commitment to promote and support open communication, at all levels of the company. \u201cI encourage you to speak up and report activity or behavior that doesn\u2019t seem right,\u201d Hayes wrote in the letter. \u201cThere are multiple channels available to employees to report concerns either directly or anonymously.\u201d He said the company takes each reported concern seriously and thoroughly investigates. \u201cWe will not tolerate retaliation against any employee who reports wrongdoing \u2014 regardless of the outcome of the investigation.\u201d Boeing Co.

{"link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-consumer-companies-can-thrive-in-the-age-of-millennials-2018-02-09", "source": "https://www.marketwatch.com/", "text": "Published: Younger people prefer experiences over products, so smart marketers will combine the two By One of the most popular toys on the market this past holiday season was something called L.O.L. Surprise! The line of small dolls that children can collect and dress in various outfits flew off the shelves. But the unique thing about the dolls isn\u2019t what they wear, but how they are packaged. Rather than a typical box, each doll comes inside a large plastic ball that contains up to a dozen layers of different \u201csurprises,\u201d including stickers, charms, outfits and other accessories. The experience of opening this package is a large part of the appeal. opening each ball are generating millions of views on YouTube, which is also integrated into their brand site and has all manner of interactive features, printouts and \u201ccollectibles,\u201d bolstered by the highly downloaded \u201cL.O.L. Surprise Ball Pop\u201d apps. There may be no better metaphor for companies looking to connect with millennials (and clearly, their children). Today, how this generation experiences, communicates and shares information about products is in many ways more important than the product itself, and critical to brand building. Yesterday\u2019s shopping experiences are no longer relevant. With our devices, we\u2019re summoning rides through Uber, ordering groceries online via smart lists, subscribing to and binge-watching our TV shows through Netflix Everything is on-demand, everything is personalized and everything is available right now. And when we like our experiences, we share with those we care about. The lesson here: You\u2019d better understand, authentically connect to, interact, serve \u2014 and, yes, trust your consumers with your brand. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll be able to deliver value and loyalty. It is this reality that is driving three major interrelated changes in retail.   Millennials prefer offerings that feel unique to them as individuals rather than something that is generic or appeals to everyone. That said, the products themselves don\u2019t need to be customized to each individual. Products that feel personalized, through the experience of buying it reflect a company that knows how to communicate with its consumers and understands what they want. This can happen instantly and at scale through devices, driven by data about you and only you. The brands that have the most information about how people engage with their offerings and know how to weaponize that data through advanced analytics are going to be most likely to get personalized experiences right and drive value for both the consumer and the brand. For example, the way Apple approaches design and marketing, and the way it delivers on its value proposition are all about simplifying the complex and allowing individualism and self-expression. Nothing is more personal \u2013 or personalized \u2014 than what you experience and share through your phone. Apple\u2019s advertising reflects this. Deep connections between people and their preferred brands are becoming table stakes, not just for technology companies, but because of them. Consumers have been trained to expect personal, expect easy, and expect service.   Tightly connected to personalization through experience is the blurring between what we traditionally think of as a \u201cproduct\u201d manufactured by a brand and what we think of as a \u201cservice.\u201d Unlike products, services can be improved and updated 24/7, at relatively low cost. Again, we can thank the progressively higher capability and lower costs of advanced digital solutions for this. Sun Basket is a great example. A meal-kit delivery service with vegetarian, gluten-free and paleo offerings, the company studies its data to sharpen its offerings, creating highly personalized \u2014 even if not entirely customized \u2014 recipes. It can easily extend this service platform to provide new sources of growth and ways to serve an already loyal customer base. Or consider Thrive Market, which at first appears to simply be an organic e-commerce retailer. A deeper look shows that Thrive is actually selling a lifestyle with a robust business intelligence unit and an in-house content production team. It caters very specifically to its customers\u2019 behavior and feedback, particularly around the importance of a shared social mission. Its product sales enable this, but Thrive\u2019s proposition can stretch to other lifestyle choices beyond organic food. It\u2019s less about what you\u2019re selling and more about making sure that you\u2019re maximizing every single occasion for people to use your offering as opposed to others. Millennials are the first generation that is truly primed for this reality, and they\u2019re starting to expect it from the companies they buy from. Soon, I expect to see just about every brand having a service component to their offerings.   In the era of \u201cfake news\u201d it is perhaps not surprising that studies indicate that people trust other people more than they do brands. Due to the explosion of devices, people now create more information about brands and products, both good and bad, than any one company could possibly create themselves. Increasingly, this means the only way for brands to authentically reach people is to focus on how people are talking about their offerings to others, and to use this as a means of connecting with them. To be sure, a carefully crafted brand proposition is still key, but now in many ways your brand is really what people say it is when you are not in the room. Harness user-generated content and use it in your marketing strategy. Understand how the true perception of your brand (is it even yours anymore?) can positively drive how people search for, interact with and buy your products. Develop relationships and listen to your consumers. They\u2019ll tell you what they want. The time is now to invest in the new technologies that will make these insights possible and actionable. Companies that ignore these changes and hold on to the marketing tactics of the past increasingly do so at their own peril.   Join the conversation Copyright \u00a9 2018 MarketWatch, Inc.

It\u2019s not all their fault, though, as information is often dumbed down in the interest of simplicity. As Einstein said: \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler.\u201d Unfortunately, often the information provided to average investors has been simplified below the bare minimum. To avoid the blunder, average investors need a bit of sophistication. To fully understand how to avoid the blunder, let us first start with a chart that illustrates the point. Read on for the blunder and how to avoid it.   Please click for the chart of iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF Please observe the following important points on the chart: \u2022 The chart shows that TLT has fallen about 18% from its recent peak. \u2022 An average investor who bought near the peak to collect about 2.75% interest has now lost about 18% of the principal. \u2022 If interest rates normalize even to the recent low levels, an average investor who bought near the peak will lose 42% of the principal.         Many average investors believe the myth that bonds are safe. There is some truth to the understanding that bonds are safer than stocks, but average investors miss an important nuance. If you buy an individual Treasury bond or a bond of a company with a solid balance sheet and hold it to maturity, you will get your principal back. However, this is not the case when you buy mutual funds or ETFs.   Many average investors are advised to start with 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds. Of course, adjustments are made based on age and objectives. Investors are told that stocks are for growth and bonds are for safety and income. Many average investors do not understand that they can lose a lot of money in bonds.   Bonds have been in a 30-year bull market. For this reason, the bad advice given to investors has not hurt them so far. However, average investors need to know that the bull market has ended.   As stock market volatility has risen, many average investors who want safety are moving out of stocks into bonds. They are doing so because they do not understand the following: \u2022 They can lose money in bonds, as illustrated in the chart linked above. \u2022 Interest rates are rising. \u2022 Bonds move inverse to interest rates. In plain English, when interest rates go higher, bonds go lower. \u2022 Stocks are experiencing volatility because of rising interest rates.   First and foremost, do not buy bond funds or ETFs. Second, understand that most funds and popular ETFs are concentrated in a handful of stocks that have run up and now pose a high risk. For example, the top holdings of popular ETF are Apple Microsoft and Facebook Alphabet  is right there too. These are also the top holdings of popular ETF along with Nvidia Netflix and Qualcomm  The point is that many investors are overly concentrated in technology stocks.

The number of inputs is staggering. Setting aside the complexity, the simplest thing investors can do to gain valuable insight is to look at patterns. To explore what might be next for stocks, let\u2019s look at a chart.   Please click to see an annotated chart of S&P 500 futures Similar conclusions can be drawn from popular ETFs such as S&P 500 ETF Nasdaq 100 ETF and small-cap ETF It is more instructive to use a futures chart because futures trade overnight and there is a very important point on the chart that is visible only on the futures chart. Please note the following from the chart: \u2022 In recent history, most of the very shallow dips formed a V pattern. In a V pattern, the dip is bought and the market recovers. When the market dipped this time, many were expecting a V bottom. The chart shows that a V bottom did not occur. This was addressed in the early stages of the stock market dip, when many gurus were predicting a V bottom. From the Morning Capsule made available to subscribers of The Arora Report: \u201cIf the stock market continues to go up from here, it would have formed a V bottom yesterday. Historically, V bottoms are less common than the retest. If a retest were to occur, the market would fall back to yesterday\u2019s lows. The momo [momentum] crowd likely has stops under yesterday\u2019s lows. A typical scenario would be hunt-and-destroy algorithms to become active, take out stops of the momo crowd and then for the market to rebound. If a retest occurs and it fails, then the probability of something more than a garden-variety correction will rise.\u201d This observation has now proven spot on. A V bottom did not occur this time. \u2022 The chart shows that a retest of the prior low marked with a horizontal white line is in progress. \u2022 The chart shows two scenarios from here on that will result in a bullish W pattern. These are shown with green dotted lines on the chart. \u2022 The chart also shows two scenarios if the retest fails. This will be a bearish break. These scenarios are shown with dotted red lines on the chart.        It is high time to remind investors of Arora\u2019s Second Law Of Investing: \u201cNo one knows with certainty what is going to happen next.\u201d The best way to handle uncertainty is to think in terms of probabilities. The probability of a bullish W pattern forming is significantly higher than a bearish break.   In addition to the simple chart, those interested in a comprehensive approach may look at The Arora Report timing model with inputs in 10 categories. The model is adaptive, i.e., it changes automatically with market conditions. To see the 10 inputs, please click .   Many investors are overly concentrated in technology. Some investors mistakenly think that just because they own several ETFs and mutual funds, they are diversified. Take a look at the holdings of your ETFs and mutual funds. You will find over-concentration in Apple Microsoft Facebook Amazon and Google  If there is a bearish break, those stocks have the highest risk. If you are overly concentrated, consider trimming the positions on bounces in the market.

{"link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tax-overhaul-will-lead-to-as-many-ratings-downgrades-as-upgrades-says-sp-2018-02-08", "source": "https://www.marketwatch.com/", "text": "Published: Companies are unlikely to use much of the savings to permanently reduce debt, and most will spend it on shareholders By The will likely lead to as many ratings downgrades as upgrades, as companies will spend most of the savings on shareholder returns or mergers and acquisitions, S&P Global Ratings said Thursday. While corporate borrowers are still working to evaluate the full impact on their business, S&P is not expecting them to use much of the extra cash to permanently reduce debt, leaving leverage tolerance levels unchanged.    \u201cAs a result, we believe reform-related ratings changes of more than one notch will be rare, and upgrades and downgrades are both equally likely,\u201d said analysts led by Michael Altberg and David Tesher in a new report. \u201cWhile some upgrades will stem from sustained improvements in credit metrics, downgrades could result from either the direct negative effects of tax reform or shifts in financial policy.\u201d       The main beneficiaries of the tax revamp are investment-grade issuers, those rated at BBB-minus or higher, and crossover credits, or those with ratings that span the investment and speculative grades. Most of those are unlikely to make significant changes to their leverage-tolerance levels in an effort to get a higher rating, said the report.       It cited as an example Comcast Corp.\u2019s recent statement that it would keep leverage at about 2.2 times instead of lowering it. \u201cSimilarly, we expect Apple Inc.\u2019s use of its roughly $163 billion of surplus cash balances to be heavily skewed toward share repurchases,\u201d said the report.       Companies with less optimal capital structures \u2014 such as high-yield issuers, or those rated BB-plus and lower \u2014 may pursue debt repayment and deleveraging more enthusiastically, but S&P is not expecting major changes to capital structures. \u201cMore likely, issuers will make incremental adjustments, especially when deciding how to address interest-deductibility caps,\u201d said the report. Still, the credit implications vary across sectors with those that have traditionally had higher effective tax rates \u2014 media and entertainment, business services and health-care companies \u2014 expected to benefit most from the drop in the statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%. For regulated utilities, the lower tax rate is a credit negative, as they will be pressured to pass the savings on to customers. Other sectors will not benefit much as they have historically made good use of deductions and deferrals that allowed them to pay way less than the 35% rate. The provision that limits interest deductibility is a clear negative, but may have a more subdued credit impact than originally feared, said the report.    \u201cWithin the oil and gas sector, for example, we expect tax reform to have a low impact due to the extensive net operating losses [that] many issuers have accrued over the last few years,\u201d said the report. The limits are expected to apply to about half of S&P\u2019s speculative-grade universe, but many of these highly leveraged issuers, especially those that have gone through leveraged buyouts, don\u2019t pay taxes. Those companies may more quickly exhaust net operating losses, however. The repatriation tax and shift to a territorial tax system will mostly impact those sectors with large overseas cash balances, notably technology companies, like Apple, and companies in health-care-related businesses that used tax inversions to lower their tax bills. Apple shares have gained 22% in the last 12 months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 22.5% and the S&P 500 has gained 15%. S&P is expecting those companies to permanently reduce their cash position over time. Apple has already said it would seek to become net cash neutral. \u201cThis could fundamentally alter the landscape of these sectors and lead to weaker liquidity, less-flexible balance sheets, and tighter cushions against downgrade thresholds over time,\u201d said S&P. Other possible secondary affects include shifts in financial policy, if companies come under pressure from activists to return more cash to shareholders. Some issuers may seek to issue debt in high-tax foreign jurisdictions that still allow interest deductibility, a move that could have a knock-on effect on existing debt instruments, depending on how much money is raised \u201cUltimately, domestic unsecured borrowings are more likely to be harmed than helped by increased foreign borrowings,\u201d said the report.    Moody\u2019s Investors Service said last month that it does not expect the tax bill to have much impact on the economy, also predicting that companies would use savings to reward shareholders, while the income-tax cut for the wealthy will not trickle down.

Shares of the Apple Inc. have soared over 750% in the last 10 years \u2014 more than eight times the return of the S&P 500 It pushed aside Exxon Mobil a few years ago to become the largest U.S. company by market capitalization, and has a good shot at being the nation\u2019s first-ever trillion-dollar stock. In fact, just Apple\u2019s $280 billion stockpile of cash and investments is more than the value of all but 13 other S&P 500 corporations. The iPhone is an iconic device that has won over consumers, the steady flow of profits have won over shareholders... what\u2019s not to like? Apparently plenty. The Dow Jones Industrial Average twice slumped more than 1,000 points in a single session this past week and the major indexes are down about 2% year-to-date \u2014 but Apple shares have skidded 7.7% in 2018, thanks in part to trouble after . Has Apple actually lost a step, and facing trouble in 2018? Or is this downturn just an overreaction that will present a rare buying opportunity on this stock? Personally, I think it\u2019s the latter. There are indeed signs of weakening at Apple, but the enormity of this company and its bulletproof balance sheet make it a stock to hold for the coming year \u2014 and perhaps decade. But let\u2019s pop the hood and take a look at the good, the bad and what\u2019s next for Apple. Look, everyone likes to talk about the same old things with Apple. It\u2019s huge, it\u2019s got a ton of cash and its forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 12 is significantly lower than most other S&P components. But those arguments for the stock are well-worn. A deeper look at Apple\u2019s fiscal first-quarter report, marking the end of the December quarter and released on Feb. 1, shows a few powerful trends that are at work under the radar. They include:  We talk a lot about the need for iPhone launches to juice revenue. However, let\u2019s not overlook the amazing reach of Apple. , a 30% increase from two years ago. And even when these folks don\u2019t buy the latest iPhone or iPad release, they are still buying briskly in the App Store and on iTunes; in the latest SEC filing, its \u201cservices\u201d arm that includes digital content tallied $8.5 billion in quarterly sales \u2014 more than total iPad or Macbook sales, and up an impressive 18% year-over-year. This is an amazing baseline unshackled from the upgrade cycle, and one that continues to grow briskly.  Speaking of an amazing baseline, consider that Apple also generated nearly $1.5 billion in interest and dividend income from its ridiculous stockpile of cash. That\u2019s up from $1.2 billion a year ago, thanks to the growth in its bank account. The SEC filing revealed the average rate of return was about 2.1% \u2014 up from 1.9% a year ago \u2014 and if the Federal Reserve continues to raise rates, that could pick up even more in the coming year.  We talk a lot about buybacks, but what do they mean? Apple\u2019s latest filing shows us in living color. As of Jan. 19, the company had 5.07 billion shares of common stock in circulation. . Longer term, that\u2019s down and . This persistent and aggressive repurchase plan should not be overlooked as a powerful way to defend per-share earnings and create a foundation for share prices going forward. If some Apple bulls are lazy with their arguments about scale, many bears are equally tedious with continued talk about dependence on iPhone revenue. These takes were out hot and heavy after earnings, with talk of disappointing iPhone trends and how consumers stick with their old devices for three or four years nowadays instead of just one or two. So let\u2019s look beyond that upgrade cycle argument, and dig deeper into the fundamentals of how Apple makes its money \u2014 because there are worrisome signs, even if they\u2019re not as easy to see from 10,000 feet.  Forget tired arguments about customers waiting to upgrade \u2014 let\u2019s talk about how those upgrades aren\u2019t as valuable anymore. Perhaps the most disturbing sign I saw in is that margins dropped across the last three months of 2017, from 38.5% in 2016 to 38.4% in 2017. That\u2019s hardly a big decline, but incredibly noteworthy given the exorbitant price tags of $999 and $1,149 on the newly launched iPhone X. Apple\u2019s game has always been higher-priced items driving higher margins, but even after moving up into four figures it couldn\u2019t improve profitability at all. That\u2019s a big red flag.  Revenue increased almost 11% year-over-year in China, but that\u2019s only slightly better than growth in the Americas. And from a raw revenue perspective, the region represents only 20% of total sales, down from 21% at the same time a year ago. Throw a January report from that iOS devices are losing market share in the region and it doesn\u2019t bode well for growth in this key region. Remember, there\u2019s no upgrade cycle if you don\u2019t get consumers hooked on your product in the first place, and this region is full of valuable potential customers Apple is struggling to reach.  Of course, I\u2019m just a balding stock picker who gets things wrong constantly. But you may be interested that a host of pedigreed investors are souring on Apple stock, with downgrades recently from Nomura, BMO Capital Markets and Bernstein just to name a few. Additionally, Goldman Sachs  \u2014 hardly any upside from here. The so-called smart money can be stupid at times, but when Wall Street moves in the same direction it can often be painful to go the other way. Remember this before you chalk up the declines in this stock to simply being punished along with the broader market. Of course, this is all Monday morning quarterbacking. If you\u2019re an Apple shareholder \u2014 or a prospective dip buyer \u2014 what you\u2019re interested in is how the stock moves going forward. Here are a few things to watch:  Apple officially hit \u201ccorrection\u201d territory over the last week or so, with a 10% decline from its 52-week high of $180. Furthermore, Apple broke below its 200-day moving average of around $158 on Thursday afternoon, and its steep fade into that close was not encouraging. If the market-wide volatility continues and pushes shares under their September lows around $150, the next stop could be much lower.  We talk a lot about the most recent earnings reports for good reason, but remember that the stock market is a forward-looking indicator. And while the overall numbers were objectively strong in this report \u2014 revenue up almost 13% to beat the Street\u2019s targets and comfortably top internal guidance, earnings that handily topped consensus and records across several areas of the business \u2014 the future didn\u2019t look so hot. That included second-quarter revenue guidance and margin guidance . This, even with the prospect of lower tax rates, does not inspire confidence for the next three months. That means it could be hard for Apple stock to break out of its rut until the next 10-Q drops.  The idea of an iPhone \u201csupercycle,\u201d where a new gadget opens a floodgate of demand, seems highly unlikely this year after the tepid results immediately after the iPhone X launch. However, it\u2019s not crazy to think that we will see a modest but sustained growth cycle over 2018 \u2014 and perhaps 2019 and beyond \u2014 that will show Apple still has something to offer. Right now, investors are resetting their expectations as to how dynamic the company\u2019s growth path is. But if Apple can consistently prove that path is still higher, Wall Street will surely come back in force to this tech powerhouse. Of course, that narrative isn\u2019t as easy to detect via one big earnings report, so investors will have to look more closely at the stock over many more weeks to figure this one out.

Networks have also taken risks and created some of the most creatively inspired and high-quality work on TV in years \u2014 shows such as \u201cAtlanta,\u201d \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d and \u201cThe Good Place\u201d \u2014 leading critics to talk of a \u201cGolden Age\u201d of TV. But at the same time, traditional networks have started mimicking film studios and are churning out familiar content to try to catch audiences\u2019 attention. The CW, owned by Time Warner Inc. and CBS Corp. said last month that it would reboot \u201cCharmed,\u201d the Warner Bros. show about a trio of sisters who are powerful witches that first aired in 1998. The show starred Shannen Doherty, Holly Marie Combs, Alyssa Milano and later Rose McGowan. Combs has been vocal on Twitter criticizing the plan to revive the series. Here\u2019s the thing. Until you ask us to rewrite it like Brad Kern did weekly don\u2019t even think of capitalizing on our hard work. Charmed belongs to the 4 of us, our vast amount of writers, crews and predominantly the fans. FYI you will not fool them by owning a title/stamp. So bye. CBS has announced plans to reboot \u201cMurphy Brown,\u201d Walt Disney Co.\u2019s ABC is bringing back \u201cRoseanne\u201d and Comcast Corp.-owned NBC is reviving \u201cThe Office.\u201d    Then there\u2019s \u201cWill & Grace\u201d already airing again on NBC, \u201cMacGyver\u201d on CBS and 21st Century Fox Inc.\u2019s broadcast network brought back \u201cThe X-Files.\u201d Media analyst Barton Crockett notes that tapping into popular old TV shows is a practice that Netflix Inc. has used for years, as it built up its original content library. The streaming giant has revived \u201cArrested Development,\u201d \u201cFull House\u201d and recently brought back \u201cQueer Eye for the Straight Guy,\u201d to name a few. \u201cSuccess begets copy cats. Netflix has seemingly been pretty successful doing this\u201d said Crockett, an analyst at B. Riley FBR. The recent surge in TV reboots has drawn some , who are questioning whether TV executives, like studio execs, have run out of ideas. But it\u2019s not so much about an idea well drying up \u2014 the number of scripted TV shows , up from 455 in 2016. The issue facing networks, rather, is the increased competition from new streaming platforms.       \u201cTV\u2019s not running out of ideas. But because the audience is so overwhelmed with choice, one way that networks \u2014 the traditional broadcast networks in particular \u2014 attempt to cut through the clutter is with familiar brand names,\" said Alan Sepinwall, TV critic and author of \u201cTV (The Book): Two Experts Pick the Greatest American Shows of All Time.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a lot easier to grab someone\u2019s attention by saying, \u2018\u2018Will & Grace\u2019 is back!\u2019 than by saying, \u2018Here\u2019s a show that in certain ways might remind you of how you once felt about \u2018Will & Grace.\u2019\u201d The recent surge in demand from services like Netflix, Amazon.com Inc. Hulu, and the CBS All Access\u2019s of the world for content has forced networks to leave no stone unturned. Things are bound to get more desperate as Apple Inc. and Facebook Inc. toss their deep pocketbooks into the ring. Networks have also looked to tested intellectual property with built-in fan bases to mine new TV series. On Disney\u2019s most recent quarterly conference call, Chief Executive Bob Iger said the company is in the process of developing a few \u201cStar Wars\u201d series for its upcoming streaming service. In 2015 CBS said it would make \u201cStar Trek: Discovery,\u201d now streaming on CBS All Access, and Amazon paid a reported $250 million last year for the rights to make a \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d TV show.    In Hollywood this model has worked to varying degrees of success. On one side are the likes of Disney and its plans for live-action remakes of some of its most popular films. Last year\u2019s \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d was the second highest-grossing film of 2017, and 2016\u2019s \u201cThe Jungle Book\u201d grossed $966.6 million worldwide and was well received by critics. The past couple of years have also seen moviegoers reject the Hollywood cycle of reboots, franchises and remakes. The quality of some of these films, like \u201cBen-Hur\u201d in 2016 and \u201cBaywatch\u201d last year, coupled with audiences\u2019 indifference, led to the overall box office underperforming.       The fragmented TV landscape may help audiences overlook the reboot trend. \u201cThere are so many more shows available all over the place that are original titles, whereas the way the movie business runs, your local theater might only have remakes and sequels some weeks,\u201d Sepinwall said. \u201cMost of these [TV] remakes and revivals haven\u2019t worked, but enough of them have that we\u2019re going to keep getting them.\u201d Trey Williams reports for MarketWatch from New York.
