{"tick": "AAPL", "author": "ChuckJones", "text": "Digging into Apple\u2019s 10-Q can provide additional insights into the company\u2019s performance and outlook. The $29 battery replacement program does not seem to be adding to warranty accruals. The company\u2019s commitments to buy components and products from its vendors increased 40% year over year. The diluted share count could drop by 60 million in the March quarter. Apple\u2019s (NASDAQ: ) 10-Q filing contains a number of financial details that provides additional information about what transpired in the most recent quarter and what the future may hold. When digging into it, you can see what gross margin would be without the accrued warranty expense, which is a \u201ccleaner\u201d number on how much it costs the company to provide its products and services and the operating profit margins for the five geographies. Apple also lets you know what interest rate it actually earns on its cash and investments and how much in components and products it has committed to buy from its manufacturing partners. Apple accrued a significantly lower amount of warranty accruals compared to a year ago. In the December 2016 quarter, there was $2.3 billion of accruals, or 3.0% of revenue. In the latest quarter, the amount was $1.5 billion, or 1.7% of revenue. When you add the company\u2019s warranty accruals back to the reported gross margin, it provides some insight into the cost of producing its products. For the December 2016 quarter, the adjusted gross margin was 41.5% versus last quarter\u2019s 40.1%. There are at least two takeaways from the lower warranty accruals and gross margin. The first is that even with a $999 and $1,149 iPhone X the margins were not higher, as typically, higher-priced items tend to have higher margins. The second is that the battery issue where Apple is . Apple provides details for the operating profit for its five geographic regions. It is worthwhile to monitor the year-to-year trends and, to a lesser degree, which regions are more or less profitable. The total operating margin includes expenses for research & development and various corporate expenses, which the geographies do not. Therefore, the total operating margin is lower when compared to the geographies. The Americas, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific saw their operating margins decline year over year. Europe and Greater China had increases. Apple\u2019s cash and investments generated $1.45 billion in interest income with a return of 2.11%. Its interest expense increased from $525 million a year ago to $734 million in the December quarter. The company doesn\u2019t provide a blended rate for its interest expense, but when you divide the interest expense into an average of last quarter\u2019s and the current quarter\u2019s debt, it is approximately 2.5%. Apple\u2019s capital plan remained $16 billion for fiscal 2018, of which $2.2 billion was spent in the first fiscal quarter. This compares to $14.9 billion for all of fiscal 2017. Since the company has generated over $63 billion in operating cash flow the past two years, it can easily handle this level of capital expenditure. Apple buys components from its suppliers. In this regard, its 10-Q says, \u201cThe Company utilizes several outsourcing partners to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company\u2019s products and to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers periods up to 150 days.\u201d A year ago, Apple had committed to buy $24 billion worth of components and products from its suppliers, and at the end of the September quarter, it was $37.6 billion. While it decreased from the September quarter to $33.5 billion at the end of December, it did increase 40% year over year. The higher level may be due to buying components that management thinks may be in tight supply or excess inventory that needs to be worked off. It will probably take a couple of quarters to tell which one it is. I track the number of actual shares that are outstanding about three weeks after the quarter ends to get a feel on what the diluted share count used for the EPS calculation could fall to in the current quarter. It isn\u2019t an exact correlation, but can be fairly accurate. The number of common shares outstanding as of January 19 was 5.074 billion, down 60 million from 5.134 billion on October 20, 2017. Based on historical trends using this is a reasonable decrease in the number of diluted shares in the March quarter. There were 5.158 billion diluted shares in the December quarter, so the March quarter number should be just under 5.1 billion. This is before Apple does a large buyback with its overseas cash that .   I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

{"tick": "AAPL", "author": "Oleh Kombaiev", "text": "Judging from the PEG multiple, Apple\u2019s price has now approached the fair level. Apple still is overvalued in terms of analysis of internal growth. DCF valuation indicates a moderate potential for further growth of Apple. A comprehensive valuation of Apple (NASDAQ: ) after the publication of the last quarter results allows one to expect only the neutral dynamics of the company's value in the nearest quarter. First, let\u2019s take a quick look at the dynamics of total return. Including the current February result, the total return of Apple\u2019s shares has been showing a negative result and a downtrend over the last three months. The current month\u2019s returns are within the bounds of natural volatility so far, but frankly, the situation does not inspire optimism. Now, let\u2019s look at Apple\u2019s multiples. Given the uniqueness of Apple\u2019s business model and the stage of its life cycle, I consider it inappropriate to directly compare the multiples of Apple with those of other companies, simply because Apple doesn\u2019t have direct competitors. In this case, in my opinion, the most optimal multiples are the P/E and P/S adjusted for the projected growth in profits and revenues, respectively. For the first comparison, I took Alibaba (NYSE: ) and the companies from the FAAMG list. Here's what I got: And, here is the of a similar comparison at the end of November 2017: Judging by the P/S to growth (forward) multiple, Apple remains significantly overvalued, although the situation has somewhat improved over two months. But the investors are hardly inclined to evaluate Apple based on its revenue growth. As for the P/E to growth (forward) multiple, it indicates that Apple\u2019s shares are now, unlike two months ago, almost perfectly balanced. It happened mainly because the consensus of analysts\u2019 regarding the growth of Apple\u2019s EPS in the period from 2018 to 2019 rose from 7% in November to the current 11%. If you compare Apple to a broader list of companies using this method, the result is more optimistic: judging by the P/E to growth (forward), Apple even has a slight potential for growth: Let's move on and look at how the growth of Apple's financial indicators relate to the current level of its multiples. In the Q4, the EPS of Apple grew by 16.25% YOY, and it is the fastest growth rate for the last eight quarters. However, the long-term trend remains disappointing: in the Q4, the three-year CAGR EPS totaled 9.46% - this is the worst result in its history. At the same time, the P/E is still at the level of the year 2017 and substantially above the median. We record the company\u2019s reassessment here. The situation with the EBITDA is similar. In the O4, the four-year CAGR of EBITDA amounted to the minimum historical value. However, the EV/EBITDA remains above the median. Note that matching of the CAGR of EBITDA with the EV/EBITDA has a distinct wave nature. Judging from the cycle, the EV/EBITDA is now at the top of yet another wave. The growth rates of Apple\u2019s OpFCF in the last quarter is not significantly higher than those in other 2017 quarters. However, the EV/OpFCF stays near the maximum levels for the past seven years. Let\u2019s look at Apple\u2019s capitalization from the different angle. In the Q4, Apple\u2019s ROE amounted to the maximum value in the year 2017. At the first glance, it is not bad. However, the P/BV multiple remains substantially higher than its balanced values within the dependencies between the specified indicators. Assuming that the observed drop in Apple prices continues, the capitalization of Apple will drop to $720 billion before the P/BV reaches a balanced level. As we can see, in the Q4, the long-term growth rate of the key financial indicators of Apple continued to slow down. However, the main company\u2019s multiples, although slightly declined, are still above their median values. Now, let's see what the DCF analysis says about the fair price of Apple. you can find a detailed description of the DCF model I built for Apple. Now, I will only update the calculations. First of all, it should be noted that after the publication of the Q4 results, the analysts have slightly lowered Apple's revenue forecast for the next two years. Here's what they were like in November 2017: Here's what they look like now: Therefore, I\u2019ve adjusted my 10-year forecast of Apple\u2019s revenue: Here is the WACC calculation: The current 1-y Beta Coefficient of Apple is 1.1, which is still substantially above the median, but below the peaks demonstrated at the beginning of 2018: I assume that Apple's operating margin will gradually decrease to the level of 18% due to the increased competition. So, here's the model itself: The DCF-based target price of Apple's shares is $191, The observed decline in Apple\u2019s value amidst the fall of the entire U.S. stock market has benefited Apple, and, judging by the multiples, the company is now close to its balanced state. The key financial indicators of Apple demonstrated acceleration in the Q4, but it may be only a one-time success because the long-term trends remain negative. Apple\u2019s Beta Coefficient demonstrates a decrease, which has a positive impact on the DCF valuation of the company. However, the 18% growth potential cannot be called impressive. As I\u2019ve mentioned in my previous articles ( , ), I still believe that in the coming quarters, Apple's shares will move sideways in the best case scenario, because the lack of confident signs of the company\u2019s accelerating growth runs counter to its chronically overestimated multiples.

Zacks Equity Research      (   )\t reported solid fourth-quarter 2017 results wherein the top and the bottom lines came ahead of the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate and also improved year over year. The company\u2019s non-GAAP earnings per share came in at 29 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents. Also, reported earnings increased from 18 cents earned in the year-ago quarter. Notably, shares of Paycom Software have surged a whopping 90.7% in the past year, outperforming the \u2018s increase of just 21.2%. Paycom Software reported revenues of $114.03 million, which increased 30% from the year-ago quarter. Revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $113 million. The year-over-over increase can be attributed to the addition of clients, new business wins and product development initiatives. Moreover, revenues were impacted positively by a 29.4% year-over-year increase in recurring revenues and approximately 56% increase in implementation and other revenues. The company\u2019s adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points (bps) on a year-over-year basis to 83.8%, primarily due to a higher revenue base. Paycom Software\u2019s adjusted EBITDA increased 54% year over year to $31.8 million. As a percentage of revenues, total administration expenses decreased to 60.9% from 64.3% reported in the year-ago period. Non-GAAP net income came in at $16.8 million compared with $10.8 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Paycom Software exited the fourth quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $46.1 million compared with $66.6 million in the previous quarter. Accounts receivables were $1.6 million compared with $1.4 million reported in the previous quarter. The company\u2019s balance sheet comprises long-term debt of $34.4 million compared with $33.2 million reported in the previous quarter. It generated cash flow from operations of $130.6 million in fiscal 2017. | Paycom generated revenues of $433 million in 2017, showcasing an increase of 32% from the prior year. Recurring revenues, which constituted 98% of the total figure, increased 31% on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted EBITDA came in at $137.0 million compared with $94.5 million in 2016. Non-GAAP net income per share increased 49.4% from the previous year to $1.30. Notably, a cut in the federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% led Paycom to \u201crevalue and write down certain deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017\u201d. Management believes this one-time write down was essential \"to reflect the expected recovery of those assets under lower future tax rates.\" Following the tax reforms, the company\u2019s fourth-quarter net income witnessed a reduction of $0.4 million. Paycom stated that it has adopted ASC 606, effective January 1, 2018. Following the implementation of the new standards, the company would experience certain changes in expenses, specifically costs related to commissions paid to sales representatives. Previously, the company recognized commission related expenses in the quarter in which a contract was signed. Per the new standards, the commission expense will be recognized ratably over the period till which the contract is valid. This will lower sales and marketing expenses, which will boost margins. For first-quarter fiscal 2018, Paycom Software expects revenues in a range of $150-$152 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $150.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately in the range of $74-$76 million. Paycom Software also provided guidance for fiscal 2018. The company anticipates revenues in the range of $541-$543 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $543.19 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $213-$215 million. Paycom Software\u2019s better-than-expected results were backed by client additions. The company\u2019s \u201cclient retention rate,\u201d which has been hovering around 91% for almost six years in a row, is also a major positive. The company received positive feedback on its first national television commercial and the launch of its application on Apple (   )\t and Google (   )\t Play Store. The company opened three new sales offices in Milwaukee, Richmond and Long Island and with the announcement of the opening of a new sales office in Salt Lake City during the conference call, its sales team count is now 46. Management was particularly optimistic about the operations of its sales force, with senior sales people outperforming expectations. The company is optimistic about the increase in the number of companies becoming aware of the benefits of new age human resource technologies.

Overall, the trading action was a lazy back and forth as shell-shocked traders battled between short covering and preparing for another down leg in the selloff that started on Friday. The madness all started with a surprisingly strong jobs report featuring an increase in wage inflation. This raised concerns about a quickening of central bank policy tightening, higher yields and an end to the long cheap money easiness in markets. A rise in the 10-year Treasury yield to 2.84% closed in on the high hit last Friday suggesting the rates worry is set to be an ongoing headwind here as stocks try to work off the oversold technical condition.

Breadth was mixed, with advancers edging out decliners on the NYSE by about 100 issues, at 1,555. There were 46 new lows vs. 24 new highs. But there was more volume on the downside. Energy stocks were the laggards, dropping 1.7% as a group, after crude oil slid on inventory data showing a rise in stockpiles as well as the drag from the stronger greenback. The tech sector was heavy, dampening spirits, with the likes of (NASDAQ: ) and (NASDAQ: ) sliding lower for losses of 2.1% and 2.7%, respectively. (NYSE: ) was among the most actively traded, surging more than 40% after reporting better-than-expected results for the first time as a public company thanks to a recent app redesign and a surge of new users. (NYSE: )\u00a0gained 2.1%, helping lift the Dow Jones. And (NASDAQ: )\u00a0gained 88% to hit a six-month high after reporting strong results. (NYSE: ) fell 1.3% respite beating estimates. (NYSE: )\u00a0lost 10.6% after its quarterly results showed a decline in customers as multiple reports of food poisoning in recent years has tarnished the brand\u2019s image. And finally, in Washington, Republicans and Democrats in the Senate have reportedly agreed to a two-year spending deal that would raise spending caps on defense and non-defense spending by $160 billion and $130 billion, respectively, over the next two years. The weakness in Treasury bonds is shown by the downdraft in the (NASDAQ: ). Without a stabilization, it\u2019s possible the market suffers another violent decline similar to what happened on Monday and Tuesday as inverse volatility ETFs blew up. The next site of systemic carnage could be a risk parity fund that depends on stocks and bonds trading in opposite directions. The fact that both are falling right now hits these funds hard, resulting in margin calls and forced selling. The short VIX funds were \u201cexplicit\u201d bets on volatility staying abnormally low; risk parity is an \u201cimplicit\u201d bet on markets staying calm. It\u2019s the same thesis, just different implementation. And it too is now at risk. If the bulls can\u2019t step up here and force the CBOE Volatility Index lower to squeeze the late arriving volatility speculators, the turbulence could well worsen heading into Friday\u2019s session.

{"tick": "AAPL", "author": null, "text": "Published: CUPERTINO, Calif., Jan 17, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) --\nApple\u00ae today announced a new set of investments to build on its \n      commitment to support the American economy and its workforce, \n      concentrated in three areas where Apple has had the greatest impact on \n      job creation: direct employment by Apple, spending and investment with \n      Apple's domestic suppliers and manufacturers, and fueling the \n      fast-growing app economy which Apple created with iPhone\u00ae and the App \n      Store\u00ae. Apple is already responsible for creating and supporting over 2 \n      million jobs across the United States and expects to generate even more \n      jobs as a result of the initiatives being announced today. Combining new investments and Apple's current pace of spending with \n      domestic suppliers and manufacturers \u2014 an estimated $55 billion for 2018 \n      \u2014 Apple's direct contribution to the US economy will be more than $350 \n      billion over the next five years, not including Apple's ongoing tax \n      payments, the tax revenues generated from employees' wages and the sale \n      of Apple products. Planned capital expenditures in the US, investments in American \n      manufacturing over five years and a record tax payment upon repatriation \n      of overseas profits will account for approximately $75 billion of \n      Apple's direct contribution. \"Apple is a success story that could only have happened in America, and \n      we are proud to build on our long history of support for the US \n      economy,\" said Tim Cook, Apple's CEO. \"We believe deeply in the power of \n      American ingenuity, and we are focusing our investments in areas where \n      we can have a direct impact on job creation and job preparedness. We \n      have a deep sense of responsibility to give back to our country and the \n      people who help make our success possible.\" Apple, already the largest US taxpayer, anticipates repatriation tax \n      payments of approximately $38 billion as required by recent changes to \n      the tax law. A payment of that size would likely be the largest of its \n      kind ever made.   Apple expects to invest over $30 billion in capital expenditures in the \n      US over the next five years and create over 20,000 new jobs through \n      hiring at existing campuses and opening a new one. Apple already employs \n      84,000 people in all 50 states. The company plans to establish an Apple campus in a new location, which \n      will initially house technical support for customers. The location of \n      this new facility will be announced later in the year. Over $10 billion of Apple's expanded capital expenditures will be \n      investments in data centers across the US. Over the last decade, Apple \n      has invested billions of dollars in data centers and co-located \n      facilities in seven US states, including North Carolina, Oregon, Nevada, \n      Arizona, and a recently announced project in Iowa. Today, Apple is breaking ground on a new facility in downtown Reno, \n      which will support its existing Nevada facilities. All of Apple's US facilities, including offices, retail stores and data \n      centers, are powered by 100 percent renewable energy sources like solar, \n      wind and micro-hydro power, which Apple generates or purchases from \n      local projects. The new campus announced today will also be powered \n      entirely by green energy.   Building on the initial success of the Advanced Manufacturing Fund \n      announced last spring, Apple is increasing the size of the fund from $1 \n      billion to $5 billion. The fund was established to support innovation \n      among American manufacturers and help others establish a presence in the \n      US. It is already backing projects with leading manufacturers in \n      Kentucky and rural Texas. Apple works with over 9,000 American suppliers \u2014 large and small \n      businesses in all 50 states \u2014 and each of Apple's core products relies \n      on parts or materials made in the US or provided by US-based suppliers.   Apple, which has a 40-year history in education, also plans to \n      accelerate its efforts across the US in support of coding education as \n      well as programs focused on Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and \n      Math (STEAM). The iOS app economy has created more than 1.6 million jobs in the US and \n      generated $5 billion in revenue for American app developers in 2017. \n      With demand for coding skills stronger than ever, today there are more \n      than 500,000 unfilled programming-related positions across the country, \n      and the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that by 2020 there will \n      be 1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants qualified \n      to fill them.\u00b9 To address the coding skills gap and help prepare more people for jobs \n      in software development, Apple created a powerful yet easy-to-learn \n      coding language called Swift\u2122, the free Swift Playgrounds\u2122 app and a \n      free curriculum, App Development with Swift, which are available to \n      anyone and are already being used by millions of students at K-12 \n      schools, summer camps and leading community colleges across the country. \n      Over 100,000 students and teachers have also attended coding classes at \n      Apple retail stores. Apple will expand these initiatives and add new programs to support \n      teachers and teacher training. The company is also increasing funding \n      for its ConnectED program, so students in historically underserved \n      communities have a chance to learn app coding skills and enjoy other \n      benefits of technology in the classroom. Apple revolutionized personal technology with the introduction of the \n      Macintosh in 1984. Today, Apple leads the world in innovation with \n      iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV. Apple's four software \n      platforms \u2014 iOS, macOS, watchOS and tvOS \u2014 provide seamless experiences \n      across all Apple devices and empower people with breakthrough services \n      including the App Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple's more \n      than 100,000 employees are dedicated to making the best products on \n      earth, and to leaving the world better than we found it. \u00b9According to code.org, there are currently 503,338 open computing jobs \n      nationwide.

{"tick": "AAPL", "author": "Donna Fuscaldo", "text": "Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Apple Inc.\u2019s ( ) of London-based Shazam Entertainment, the song-recognition app, is raising the ire of  officials, which are taking over the review of the deal. Citing the EU, reported the move to take the review away from regulators in Austria is part of its efforts to have a closer look at that involved companies that have a lot of data, such as Shazam, but may not have enough sales to determine if it needs an EU review. EU officials, noted the Journal, have previously said that the value of the data is a type of currency to consider when evaluating whether or not to review a merger or acquisition. While the deal was registered with regulators in Austria, EU decided its regulators are \u201cthe best placed authority to deal with the potential cross-border effects of the transaction,\u201d reported the WSJ, noting that Apple is now required to register the acquisition of Shazam in Brussels. (See also: ) While the EU only has a say over a merger it the combined company will have revenue of 5 billion euros and each has 250 million euros in revenue within the EU, it can review a deal if EU member regulators or the companies request it. The Journal noted that Shazam ended 2016 with $56.2 million in revenue.\u00a0In December, Apple announced it was gearing up to acquire Shazam but didn\u2019t disclose the price tag. Media reports have pegged it at $400 million. (See also: ) It's not clear what will be the outcome of the review of the Apple-Shazam deal, but the authorities have been active in calling for asset sales and other concessions in other high-profile deals. Take Bayer\u2019s proposed acquisition of Monsanto, its U.S. rival, as one example. Bayer this week decided to sell its seeds and pesticides units to appease the EU and get its deal through. In July, the European Commission launched an inquiry into the deal and has postponed the decision on the deal from March 12 to April 5. Meanwhile, the WSJ reported last month that the EU was set to back Qualcomm Inc.\u2019s ( ) $39 million acquisition of NXP Semiconductors NV ( ) after the chipmaker pledged to relieve fears that the tie-up could lead to increased prices and less choice in the semiconductor market. The concessions include vowing to not purchase NXP\u2019s standard essential and assurances that competing chipmaker\u2019s products will still work with NXP\u2019s products.

It develops their approach \n      to problem solving, logic and reasoning, as well as reinforcing key \n      mathematical skills,\u201d said Karen Spencer, Principal of Harlow College. \n      \u201cEveryone Can Code demonstrates how any student can code by providing a \n      unique and innovative environment for learning.\u201d Swift is Apple\u2019s powerful and intuitive programming language that gives \n      developers the freedom and capabilities they need to create the next \n      generation of cutting-edge software. Popular apps including Airbnb, \n      KAYAK, TripAdvisor, Venmo and Yelp are all created with Swift. The technology sector is one of the fastest-growing industries across \n      Europe, and computing and informatics professionals are in high demand. \n      The app economy has generated 1.36 million jobs in Europe. Since the \n      launch of the App Store\u00ae, Apple has paid out nearly $18 billion to \n      developers across Europe.

{"tick": "AAPL", "author": null, "text": "Published: CUPERTINO, Calif., Jan 23, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) --\nHomePod\u2122, the innovative wireless speaker from Apple\u00ae, arrives in stores \n      beginning Friday, February 9 and is available to order online this \n      Friday, January 26 in US, UK and Australia. HomePod will arrive in \n      France and Germany this spring. HomePod delivers stunning audio quality wherever it\u2019s placed \u2014 in any \n      room in the house, playing any style of music. Using just your voice, \n      it\u2019s easy and fun to use, and works together with an Apple Music\u00ae \n      subscription for a breakthrough music experience, providing access to \n      one of the world\u2019s largest cloud music libraries. Siri\u00ae, now actively \n      used on over half a billion devices, has developed a deep knowledge of \n      music and understands your preferences and tastes. And with Siri, \n      HomePod can send a message, set a timer, play a podcast, check the news, \n      sports, traffic, and weather, and even control a wide range of HomeKit\u2122 \n      smart home accessories. \u201cHomePod is a magical new music experience from Apple. It brings \n      advanced audio technologies like beam-forming tweeters, a high-excursion \n      woofer, and automatic spatial awareness, together with the entire Apple \n      Music catalog and the latest Siri intelligence, in a simple, beautiful \n      design that is so much fun to use,\u201d said Philip Schiller, Apple\u2019s senior \n      vice president of Worldwide Marketing. \u201cWe\u2019re so excited for people to \n      get HomePod into their homes, apartments and businesses to hear it for \n      themselves. We think they will be blown away by the audio quality. The \n      team has worked to give Siri a deeper knowledge of music so that you can \n      ask to play virtually anything from your personal favorites to the \n      latest chart-topping releases, simply by saying \u2018Hey Siri.\u2019\u201d   At just under 7 inches tall, HomePod represents years of hardware and \n      software innovation:   HomePod is designed to work with an Apple Music subscription for access \n      to hundreds of genres, moods and activities. It also learns preferences \n      and tastes that are shared across devices. Using Siri to deliver deep \n      knowledge of artists, songs, albums and more, HomePod can handle \n      advanced searches within Apple Music\u2019s catalog, so users can ask \n      questions like, \u201cHey Siri, when was this song released?\u201d or \u201cHey Siri, \n      can you play something totally different?\u201d to change the mood. Apple \n      Music subscribers can enjoy a catalog of more than 45 million songs, \n      combined with their entire iTunes\u00ae library, for online or offline \n      listening \u2014 completely ad-free.   HomePod is a convenient way to send messages, set timers and reminders, \n      check the weather and listen to shows on Apple Podcasts. The latest \n      business news, headlines and sports updates stream directly to HomePod \n      from NPR, CNN, ESPN and others. HomePod can also be used as a \n      speakerphone with iPhone for crisp and clear audio quality. With support for HomeKit, HomePod can control hundreds of home \n      accessories or set scenes like, \u201cHey Siri, I\u2019m home,\u201d to control a \n      number of different accessories at the same time. HomePod can turn on \n      the lights, raise the shades, set the desired temperature or make other \n      adjustments and serves as the perfect home hub, enabling remote access \n      and automations.   Through SiriKit\u2122, HomePod supports third-party messaging apps, so users \n      can ask Siri to send a message to a friend or colleague using apps like \n      WhatsApp. Reminders, note-taking and to-do list apps like Things and \n      Evernote will automatically work with HomePod, so Siri can set \n      reminders, create a new list, mark items as complete, or create and \n      modify notes. For developers interested in adding SiriKit support, more \n      information is available at .   Coming this year in a free software update, users will be able to play \n      music throughout the house with multi-room audio. If HomePod is in the \n      kitchen, users can ask Siri to play jazz in the dining room, or play the \n      same song in each room \u2014 perfectly in sync. If there's more than one \n      HomePod set up in the same room, the speakers can be set up as a stereo \n      pair for an even more immersive sound experience.   Security and privacy are fundamental to the design of Apple hardware, \n      software and services. With HomePod, only after \u201cHey Siri\u201d is recognized \n      locally on the device will any information be sent to Apple servers, \n      encrypted and sent using an anonymous Siri identifier.   HomePod is available at an Apple retail price of $349 (US) in white and \n      space gray in the US, UK and Australia and available to order beginning \n      Friday, January 26, from and the Apple Store\u00ae app. HomePod will be available in Apple Stores and \n      at select Apple Authorized Resellers, including Best Buy in the US; \n      Argos, Dixons Carphone (Currys PC World), John Lewis, Shop Direct (Very \n      and Littlewoods), EE, and Apple Premium Resellers in the UK; and The \n      Good Guys, Harvey Norman, JB Hi-Fi, Myer and Telstra in Australia, \n      beginning Friday, February 9.

{"tick": "AAPL", "author": null, "text": "Published: LOS ANGELES, January 24, 2018 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ --\nLOS ANGELES, January 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --     - Used for all types of operations, like merchandise payments, ticketing, money transfers, and bill payments, US mobile payment transactions are now projected to reach a value USD$2.849 trillion in the year 2020- . The sky-high potential of this market is well known already to many FinTech investors, and development companies in the sector that includes  (cse:GET),    and   The study, which used 2015 numbers (USD$550 billion) as the base year for analysis, expects a whopping CAGR of 39.1% through to 2020, . In terms of use widespread use of mobile payments, China far outdoes the US, at more than 50 times the current usage. Already, -so Western developers and marketers can see what is a possibility down the road. Widespread acceptance in China of major mobile payment platforms has led to major gains from developers of platforms such as Alipay from (BABA) and TenPay from (TCEHY)-which hold a 54% and 37% market share, respectively. In North America, however, though the market is already above USD$550 billion, there is still plenty of growth expected that will come with the adoption of easy-to-use mobile payment apps. Such apps that are changing the way we pay for everything from toys to avocado toast, include Google Wallet from  Apple Pay from  Samsung Pay from  and the fast-rising restaurant app Glance Pay from (OTC: ) (CSE: ).   Possibly the fastest moving of any sector in North America, in terms of sheer number of transactions, is that of the food industry. After the rollout of fast food brand Subway's stores with self-ordering kiosks that feature support for mobile payments, a survey was done to determine how many fast food eaters use mobile payments. According to the survey, it was found that had used mobile payment services in the prior month. Much of that comes from Asia Pacific markets, where 51% of respondents said they had used their phones to pay the bill in the month before. Those included the trialed use of \"smile to pay\" , supported by Alibaba's Ant Financial affiliate. While lower in comparison to their Asian counterparts, fast food eaters in Europe (32%) and North America (26%) are a consumer base that's higher than average in their respective regions for paying via mobile. Therefore, a more wide-scale adoption can be expected to come through the food industry, perhaps faster than through big-box retail stores, such as Walmart and Target which have also recently launched mobile payment apps for their respective chains. One company that is looking to corner the market on mobile payments in North American restaurants, is (OTC: ) (CSE: )-developers of the popular and secure app Glance Pay.   Diners are becoming more accustomed to using an app to improve their dining experience-whether it's . Convenience is key, and time is precious for eat-in diners-especially during the noon-day lunch hour, when no one wants to be busted returning late to back to work. Restaurant owners also want to , resulting in higher revenues during their establishment's prime times. The more diners they can serve in an hour, the higher the likelihood that their eateries will survive. In an effort to shave valuable minutes off of everyone's least favorite part of the dining experience (paying the bill), Glance Pay from Vancouver-based developers,  (cse:GET) is improving the dining experience for customers across North America. Streamlined and designed to revolutionize how we dine, Glance Pay is a mobile payment platform helping users choose where to dine, order goods and services, make payments, access digital receipts, redeem digital deals, earn great rewards & interact with merchants. Easy to use for both diners, and restauranteurs, Glance Pay is spreading wide across its home country of Canada and soon into the US and Europe in the near future. Already, popular chains and independent restaurants are adopting Glance Pay, including Ricky's Restaurant Group with almost 150 locations in Canada, and Canada with 52 locations across the country. Seeing Glance Pay as a brand leader-or potential Uber, or AirBnB of the restaurant industry- often ranked as InsTech's #1 FinTech Influencer in the world, joined the Advisory Board of Glance Technologies. \"I'm in love with Glance's simplicity and arena of business. In some ways it's like Uber, in terms of convenience. However, I think that its placement in the restaurant business is something that could turn into a huge success story,\" said Margaris upon the . At the time of Margaris's addition to the team in late September, Glance's stock was trading at $0.375-Since then, the stock has hit a 52-week high of $3.20. \"If they can replicate what they've already done in Canada, in the US and worldwide, it'll be a billion-dollar company,\" added Margaris. \"If it enters a major US centre at the beginning of next year, and executes in a popular state such as New York, I can see a $5 share price. The sky's the limit.\" In addition to Glance Pay's ease of use, it's the app's stellar security record that has further driven its widespread acceptance. As of November, Glance Technologies officially announced its fraud on the app. Further improving upon its anti-fraud expertise, Glance Pay has introduced its own cryptocurrency which corresponds with the app's built-in customer loyalty incentives for both the restaurants and the app itself. Much like the addition of Margaris, Glance brought in more expertise, through the , Dinis Guarda to the Advisory Board. Along with the appointment, Glance acquired Guarda's company Ztudium's cryptocurrency technology, . Much like the majors and their platforms, such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, Samsung Pay etc., Glance Pay is gaining momentum across multiple outlets, in many sectors. However, its strongest sector remains in the food industry. Unlike for Apple, Google, and Samsung, investors in Glance Technologies still have plenty of blue-sky to look forward to, as they build out the brand either to market dominance, or being bought out by a major.      Alphabet Inc., more popularly known as Google, provides global online advertising services, as well as performance and brand advertising services. The Google segment includes principal Internet products, such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Google Cloud, Android, Chrome, Wallet and Google Play, as well as technical infrastructure and newer efforts, including Virtual Reality. Google Wallet is an encrypted app meant for peer to peer transactions. Alphabet Inc. was founded in 1998 and is headquartered in Mountain View, California.    Apple designs, manufactures, and markets mobile communication and media devices, personal computers, and portable digital music players to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education, enterprise, and government customers worldwide. Apple's Apple Pay is the company's contactless payment system for mobile phones, launched in 2014, and growing in popularity. Apple Pay is now available in millions of stores, like Nike, Ulta, and can be used online and in other apps and websites such as Airbnb and Lululemon.    Samsung together with its subsidiaries engages in the consumer electronics, information technology and mobile communications, and device solutions businesses worldwide. The company provides mobile payment and communication system services, as well as manufactures and sells server semiconductor storage system. Samsung's mobile payment system, Samsung Pay, is designed to replace the plastic cards in your wallet. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. was founded in 1938 and is based in Suwon, South Korea.

{"tick": "AAPL", "author": "Leo Sun", "text": "Founded in 1993 by brothers Tom and David Gardner, The Motley Fool helps millions of people attain financial freedom through our website, podcasts, books, newspaper column, radio show, and premium investing services. The smartphone market became heavily saturated over the past decade, with worldwide shipments dipping 0.1% to 1.47 billion units in 2017 according to IDC's latest numbers.\u00a0IDC attributes that slowdown to consumers in developed markets like the US and China postponing upgrades to pricier flagship devices. IDC analyst Anthony Scarsella noted that \"with ultra-high-end flagships all the rage in 2017, many of these new bezel-less wonders proved to be more of a luxury than a necessity among upgraders.\" He also noted that the \"higher price points could be outweighing the benefits of having the latest and greatest device in hand.\" Image source: Getty Images. The sluggish growth of this once-hot market might cause some investors to shun smartphone-related stocks. But if we take a closer look at IDC's market share figures for 2017, we'll notice that the top five smartphone makers in the world -- ,  , , , and -- are still posting solid growth. Samsung 317.3 million 21.6% 1.9% Apple 215.8 million 14.7% 0.2% Huawei 153.1 million 10.4% 9.9% Oppo 111.8 million 7.6% 12% Xiaomi 92.4 million 6.3% 74.5% Others 577.7 million 39.5% (11.7%) Source: IDC. Samsung and Apple still rule the smartphone market, but China's three biggest smartphone makers are gaining ground. The standout performer of the year was definitely Xiaomi, which mounted a comeback against its Chinese rivals and could launch the of 2018. But since investors can't invest in Xiaomi yet, we should take a closer look at the two top smartphone stocks to buy today -- and one popular supply chain play which you should avoid. Apple is the most profitable smartphone maker in the world. Last November, Canaccord Genuity analyst Michael Walkley estimated that Apple swallowed\u00a072% of the global smartphone industry's profits during the third quarter of 2017. That's an incredible feat for a company that only controls about 15% of the market. The reason is simple: Apple is the only smartphone maker that has consistent in a highly saturated market. A decade ago, the basic model of the first iPhone cost $499 without a contract. Today, the three newest iPhones -- the iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, and iPhone X -- respectively start at $699, $799, and $999. Apple's iPhone X. Image source: Apple. Revenues from the iPhone accounted for\u00a070% of Apple's top line last quarter. The bears will argue that the company is too heavily dependent on the device, but Apple's prisoner-taking ecosystem ensures that most iPhone users will keep upgrading to new iPhones. A Morgan Stanley survey from last May found that 92% of iPhone users were \"somewhat or extremely likely\" to upgrade to a new iPhone within the following 12 months. Apple is also aggressively expanding its Services business -- which include Apple Music, Apple Pay, Apple Care, and other software platforms -- to offset the weight of the iPhone on its top line. That unit's revenue rose 18% annually last quarter and accounted for 10% of Apple's sales. Analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to respectively grow\u00a018% and 25% this year, which are high growth figures for a stock which trades at just 13 times forward earnings. Samsung claimed just 24% of the smartphone industry's profits during the third quarter according to Canaccord Genuity, but that still makes it one of three OEMs (Huawei being the third one) which actually profit from smartphone sales. Samsung is the world's biggest smartphone maker because it sells a much wider range of devices than Apple. It's best known for its flagship Galaxy S and Galaxy Note devices, but it also sells\u00a0mid-range A, C, and J-series devices for budget-conscious consumers and emerging markets. Samsung's Galaxy S8. Image source: Samsung. Last quarter, revenue from\u00a0Samsung's IM (IT and Mobile Communications) unit rose 8% annually and accounted for 39% of its top line. Yet its DS (Device Solutions) business, which produces displays, memory chips, and other semiconductors, was the true star, posting 44% sales growth and accounting for 49% of Samsung's top line. A major growth driver for the DS business was soaring memory prices. However, Samsung also supplies components to other major device makers, including Apple. Apple uses Samsung's memory chips and displays across a large number of its iPads and iPhones, so Apple's growth strengthens its DS division. Counterpoint Technology estimates that Samsung earns about $110 for each iPhone X sold since the device uses its NAND flash memory chip, DRAM chip, and OLED display. Analysts expect Samsung's revenue and earnings to respectively rise 8% and 16% in fiscal 2018, but the stock trades at just 7 times this year's earnings estimates. Lastly, mobile chipmaker  might seem like a great smartphone play since its chips power the vast majority of smartphones worldwide. Moreover, its patent portfolio of wireless patents entitles it to a cut of the sales of every smartphone sold worldwide. Image source: Qualcomm. Unfortunately, Qualcomm also faces massive legal and regulatory headwinds which anytime soon. It's been fined by regulators in China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Europe over claims that its licensing fees are too high. Ongoing legal battles with Apple over similar issues resulted in the iPhone maker's suspension of all licensing payments to Qualcomm. Meanwhile, Qualcomm's best hope for diversifying away from its troubled mobile market -- its planned acquisition of -- remains in limbo as it a hostile takeover by . As a result, analysts expect Qualcomm's revenue and\u00a0earnings to respectively fall 4% and 22% this year. Therefore, investors should stick with well-established OEMs like Apple and Samsung instead of betting on besieged suppliers like Qualcomm.

Another aspect of Apple's longer-term growth story comes from the company's ability to increase its stock buyback to $192 billion from fiscal 2018 through fiscal 2020 and simultaneously boost its dividend payout, and the potential for \"more meaningful\" M&A activity, Hall said.

{"tick": "AAPL", "author": null, "text": "Menu Source: (NASDAQ: ) certainly hasn\u2019t had a great start to the year. First, reports announced that the production of flagship iPhone X would be cut because sales were not even close to expectations. According to Statista.com, iPhone revenue accounted for nearly 70% of revenue . When sales are down on the phone that is expected to carry the iPhone brand into the future, it\u2019s not encouraging. Nor is the fact that Apple\u2019s other hardware products are finding more competition and the premiums they commanded for years is also waning. That means lower sales and lower margins. And no big product launches on the horizon. Then the market sells off. But here is where it gets interesting. After a very volatile week \u2014 and on the heels of all this news \u2014 AAPL is off just 2.3%. That means it weathered the selloff better than (NASDAQ: ), the and the . What this says is, the market is looking beyond today. Remember, the stock market is a forward looking indicator. It isn\u2019t focused on what\u2019s happening today, but what\u2019s happening a quarter or two down the road. Some are suggesting this selloff had more to with \u2018buy the rumour, sell the news\u2019 attitude regarding the tax cuts that were passed in late 2017 and buoyed the market in January. There\u2019s talk that the tax cut won\u2019t get businesses rolling like many in the financial press \u2014 and Washington, DC \u2014 have promised. The tax cut was a good move for businesses, but not a game changing move that will drive the economy out of its 3% GDP range. And given the extra $1.3 trillion in debt the tax break adds to the US economy, 3% may be optimistic. The fact is, AAPL is a diversified, global consumer electronics company. That is a very good thing. When demand falls in the U.S., there will be regions in the world where demand is high and Apple\u2019s margins are better. What\u2019s more, the tax cut has allowed AAPL to repatriate a lot of assets it has held abroad. That means the company can do more than buy back stock and expand operations in the U.S. Also bear in mind that AAPL has an $837 billion market cap. It is a massive company. One quarter doesn\u2019t define it. Sales haven\u2019t evaporated. It launched one phone model that hasn\u2019t succeeded as it had hoped. It\u2019s not the end of the world. That means, this is a good time to wade in and buy AAPL at a discount, while everyone is panicked. These are the times when smart investors find bargains for the long term.

{"tick": "AAPL", "author": null, "text": "Menu Source: Shutterstock Since the summer, (NASDAQ: ) has pulled off an impressive rally. True, the recent volatility in the markets has taken some of the air out of the shares. Yet the gain is still about 33%. So what now? Is there still an opportunity with Cisco stock? Well, I think so. The latest earnings report certainly points to a pickup in momentum, as the company posted a nice beat on earnings and revenues. The guidance was also encouraging. After a long string of declines on the top line, the company is now forecasting . Now it\u2019s true that CSCO stock has some potential issues. Just look at the competitive environment. In the core networking business, the company must fight tough rivals like (NYSE: ), (NYSE: ), (NYSE: ) and . Yet Cisco has some major advantages, which should bolster its share price. So let\u2019s take a look. There are many technologies that are likely to benefit from long-term growth, such as cloud computing, AI (artificial intelligence) and the Internet-of-Things. All these also require sophisticated infrastructure and networking systems. No doubt, this is very good news for Cisco stock. According to , the company has roughly 51% of the worldwide switching and router market. Cisco has some major competitive strengths, like a trusted brand, a full suite of products, and massive scale. The company has also been investing aggressively to innovate its offerings. Consider the Catalyst 9000 switching platform, which has snagged more than 1,100 customers in just three months. This is what had to say about it on the latest earnings call: \u201cWe expect continued momentum throughout fiscal 2018, and we\u2019re pleased that the vast majority of Catalyst 9000 customers are buying our most advanced software subscription offer.\u201d Cisco has also seen traction with its next-generation data-center switching platform for multi-cloud environments. It includes a variety of cutting-edge technologies like network automation and intent-based networking. Over the past few years, CSCO has been restructuring its business, which has involved significant layoffs and cost cutting. But the company has also been focusing more on the software business. All in all, this is a smart move. The company has a tremendous distribution footprint and can also derive synergies with its networking platform. But software also has higher margins and better growth prospects. Another advantage is that the revenues are recurring. For the most part, CSCO has been investing in categories like security and cloud computing. Part of this has been through internal development. But of course, CSCO has also been making transformative acquisitions. Some of the notable deals include (which is a provider of analytics for networks and the data center), (a leader in machine learning and AI) and (a cloud-based operator for contact centers). Even with the run-up in Cisco stock, the valuation is still reasonable. Note that the forward price-to-earnings multiple is 15.7X. The dividend yield on CSCO stock is also attractive, at about 2.8%. By comparison, (NASDAQ: ) is at 1.83%, and (NASDAQ: ) sports a yield of 1.57%. And finally, CSCO continues to be a cash machine. During the latest quarter, cash flow from operating activities rose by 13% to $3.1 billion (the total amount in the bank is $71.6 billion). In other words, there will continue to be lots of firepower for M&A, share buybacks and dividend increases.

In addition to a visual overlay, AR may also provide audio and tactile inputs to the user, and rely upon presence and positioning technologies to present location-specific sensory inputs and information to the user. In this manner, AR represents a blending of information technology and media within a real-world environment for the benefit of consumer, business, and industrial users.    Download the full report:     The term Mixed Reality (MR) pertains to a form of hybrid reality in which physical and digital objects co-exist and interact in real-time. With MR, either virtual objects are digitally mixed into reality or real-world objects are merged into virtual worlds. The latter case is sometimes referred to as Augmented Virtuality (AV), and is one step closer to Virtual Reality (VR), as real-world objects in a virtual world take on a sense of permanency with real objects, appearing to actually exist within the virtual world.  Adding to this sense of permanency, real-world objects in a virtual world may be digitally controlled. Conversely, MR may also support manipulation of virtual objects permanently placed in the real-world. In either scenario, MR will be an important aspect of teleoperation and tele-robotics.  The primary goal of AR is to enrich the user's perception of the real-world, providing information and insights that otherwise would not be obtainable. AR use cases have grown substantially across many industry verticals within the last two years, providing significant market momentum, and indicating great promise to transform communications, content, and commerce across a wide range of sectors. The goals of MR are broad, yet directionally focused on a true merging of real and virtual worlds, which Mind Commerce believes will be a major catalyst for wide-spread acceptance and usage of VR across all major industry sectors.

{"tick": "AAPL", "author": "Philip van Doorn", "text": "Published: All but two S&P 500 companies declined By Investors got a rude awakening Monday. U.S. stocks started the day with declines. And then an acceleration occurred late in the trading day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average eventually closing down 1,175 points, or 4.6%, at 24,346. The S&P 500 Index tumbled 4.1% to 2,649. For perspective, it has been only two months (Dec. 8) since the Dow closed at a lower level than it did Monday. Look at this chart: Despite the 1,000-plus drop in the Dow, it wasn\u2019t the worst day for the index. That honor goes to Oct. 19, 1987, so-called Black Monday, when it plunged 22.6%. Here\u2019s a summary showing Dow and S&P 500 price changes, with the S&P 500 sectors sorted by how much they fell Monday: The Dow is now down 1.5% for 2018, but that follows a gain of 25.1% in 2017. The S&P 500 is now down 0.9% this year, following last year\u2019s 19.4% advance. None of the figures in this article include dividends, by the way. More perspective \u2014 the three-year chart for the S&P 500 features two major temporary pullbacks for the benchmark index in 2015: From Aug. 17 through Aug. 25, 2015, the benchmark index declined 11%, before recovering and then rising to a new closing high on Nov. 3 of that year. From that high, it bounced around and then decreased 13% through Feb. 12, 2016, before resuming a long upward climb. From Jan. 26, 2018, until Monday, the decline totaled 8%. The worst sector on Monday was financials, down 5%. It has fallen 0.2% in 2018, following a 20% gain in 2017. Health care was the second-worst sector Monday, with a 4.6% drop. It\u2019s still up 0.4% for 2018, extending last year\u2019s 20% increase. This pattern doesn\u2019t hold for all the sectors, but it sure does for the broad indices. All 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Monday: There are actually 505 stocks in the S&P 500, because several companies have two classes of common shares in the index. Monday\u2019s decline was incredibly broad \u2014 all but two S&P 500 stocks were down. Shares of Church & Dwight Co. rose 2.4% to close at $47.42, while TripAdvisor Inc. was up 3.7% to close at $35.62. Here are the 10 worst performers among S&P 500 companies on Monday: Wells Fargo & Co. was the worst-performing S&P 500 stock Monday, which may not have been a major surprise after .

Analysts at Needham cut their rating on Cirrus shares to hold from buy following the earnings release. They believe Cirrus has some potential catalysts in its future, including a greater presence in Android phones, but they're cautious given talk that Apple has meaningfully slashed its iPhone X production orders. \"While we don't like downgrading at the bottom we see little in the way of upside until there is more clarity on the stabilization of Apple's iPhone builds and tangential evidence of Cirrus' non-Apple business impacting the model,\" wrote the analysts, led by Rajvindra Gill. Shares of Cirrus are down 13% so far in 2018, while the S&P 500 has fallen 0.9%. Copyright \u00a9 2018 MarketWatch, Inc.  All rights reserved.

{"tick": "AAPL", "author": "Emily Bary", "text": "Published: Reviewers pan Siri\u2019s shortcomings and Apple\u2019s closed ecosystem By Apple Inc. may not be selling as many iPhone Xs as Wall Street had expected, but the company got a nice boost in its latest quarter from its \u201cother products\u201d segment, which was up 36% from year earlier and counts the Apple Watch and AirPod earphones among its components. This quarter, the company will be able to add a new item to that list: the delayed HomePod speaker, which finally becomes available Friday. Analysts aren\u2019t expecting much from the device, given its high price point and Apple\u2019s late entry to the market. And early reviewers, who published their initial HomePod thoughts Tuesday morning, seemed to echo these concerns, even as they praised the device\u2019s sound quality. Apple shares were up 1.1% near midday. The company announced the HomePod back in June, originally planning for a December launch. Once Apple pushed back the release, the device missed out on the holiday season, after already being years behind competing voice-controlled-speaker offerings from Amazon.com Inc and Google parent Alphabet Inc. . This was a point noted by several reviewers. \u201cAt the talking speaker party, Apple\u2019s HomePod isn\u2019t just fashionably late \u2014 it\u2019s late late,\u201d , who commented that Amazon and Google have already sold tens of millions of their own speakers. Stern was among numerous reviewers who keyed in on the smart speaker\u2019s lack of smarts. The device couldn\u2019t provide an answer when she asked who the prime minister of England was, though it fared better when Stern sharpened her phrasing and asked about the prime minister of Great Britain instead. Speakers from Google and Amazon were able to answer both versions of the question. Another concern: \u201cThe HomePod has an iPhone processor and pairs with your iPhone \u2014 yet it can\u2019t make a phone call? To use it as a speakerphone, you need to start the call on your iPhone then select the HomePod as an audio source.\u201d Brian X. Chen of the New York Times . Unlike its peers, the HomePod wasn\u2019t able to hail an Uber, explain how to make pasta or add a calendar event. \u201cSiri on HomePod is embarrassingly inadequate, even though that is the primary way you interact with it,\u201d Chen wrote. \u201cSiri is sorely lacking in capabilities compared with Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google\u2019s Assistant. Siri doesn\u2019t even work as well on HomePod as it does on the iPhone.\u201d Another key criticism cited by reviewers was Apple\u2019s \u201cwalled garden\u201d approach to compatibility. The HomePod \u201cdemands that you live entirely inside Apple\u2019s ecosystem in a way that even Apple\u2019s other products do not,\u201d . While Amazon and Google let you make Spotify your default music app on their devices, Apple won\u2019t let you dictate commands for Spotify playback on the HomePod, he joined others in noting. You can AirPlay songs from Spotify or Pandora by physically tapping on them on your phone; otherwise, you\u2019re limited to using Apple Music for voice controls. Streaming on smart speakers. Apple Music is still less popular than Spotify, and Apple is trying to drive more subscriptions to its music platform in order to boost its booming services segment. Pandora Media Inc. CEO Roger Lynch a \u201chuge mistake\u201d in an interview with MarketWatch last month. One positive theme highlighted by reviewers was the device\u2019s sound quality, however. \u201cFor a compact speaker, the HomePod offers big sound, and in testing I found it pretty much unflappable no matter what kind of music I threw its way,\u201d . \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say that about many speakers, regardless of size.\u201d Overall, she found that the speaker sounded crisper than similarly high-end ones from Google and Sonos. The HomePod sells for $349, while Sonos offers two of its Sonos One devices for that price. The Google Home Max goes for $399. In the end, sound quality wasn\u2019t enough to sell reviewers on the Apple speaker. \u201cThat\u2019s really the crux of it: the HomePod sounds incredible, but not so world-bendingly amazing that you should switch away from Spotify, or accept Siri\u2019s frustrating limitations as compared to Alexa,\u201d the Verge\u2019s Patel concluded. Apple shares are up 23% over the past 12 months, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average , of which Apple is a component, is up 22%. Emily Bary is a MarketWatch reporter based in New York.

{"tick": "AAPL", "author": "Ryan Shrout", "text": "Published: Samsung and Qualcomm amend and extend their cross-licensing deal, possibly laying to rest a legal dispute between Qualcomm and Apple By Lost in the shuffle of earnings releases last week was an important between Samsung and Qualcomm. Qualcomm thinks it will be a help in its legal battle with Apple and other vendors over licensing disputes. Qualcomm believes the extension of its licensing agreement with Samsung will enable it to lay to rest the combative legal dispute with the iPhone maker and bring along with it a boost in revenue through back-pay and future royalties. With news leaking over the weekend of from Broadcom Qualcomm continues to look for ways to show its value and potential for growth to shareholders. The battle with Apple along with the pending legal concerns in various regions, is one angle the market is watching to measure Qualcomm\u2019s long-term value. In the announcement last week, Samsung and Qualcomm agreed to amend and extend their cross-licensing agreement that allows the companies to use each other\u2019s technologies in product development. Most importantly, the Samsung agreement is part of a device-level license, meaning Qualcomm will earn a fixed amount for every smartphone Samsung ships. As Samsung is the world\u2019s largest provider of phones in the world, this is a significant win for Qualcomm. But the underlying implication of this agreement should have an impact on the ongoing legal battles between Qualcomm and Apple surrounding these very same licensing methods. The crux of Apple\u2019s dispute is that per-device licensing fees are fundamentally disadvantageous to everyone in the market, except for Qualcomm. Apple is fighting to tear up the current agreements that Qualcomm has with its vendors (which Apple is using to build its phones and avoid a direct agreement with Qualcomm) and force a per-segment or per-family licensing fee that it believes is fairer and, obviously, much less expensive. The renewed agreement with Samsung is a sign that the largest mobile-technology providers in the marketplace do not view the business practices of Qualcomm as overly aggressive or unreasonable. If Samsung finds it fair and necessary to engage with Qualcomm to license the company\u2019s patent portfolio, all while maintaining record revenue growth, there is little reason that Apple cannot, and will not, have to do the same. This marks another data point, and a big one, for Qualcomm in the ongoing legal fight. Also important is that Samsung has agreed to step away from its involvement in the Korean Fair Trade Commission investigation (and current appeal) into Qualcomm\u2019s licensing practices and business models. Considering Samsung was the instigator of the inquiry by the KFTC, this provides a higher likelihood of the appeal from the San Diego-based company being approved. In a year that has seen several legal setbacks fall upon Qualcomm, the removal of the KFTC complaint would be welcome news. Though details were sparse in the agreement announcement, the easy assumption is that Qualcomm offered Samsung an advantageous agreement in order to help clear the battle with the KFTC and use in the battle with Apple. Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) regulations do specify that licensors must offer equal terms for all partners, regardless of size and situation. But nothing precludes Qualcomm from providing additional resources (engineering help), access to additional intellectual property (IP) that would otherwise not be available, etc. A on the same day, also overlooked amid the mass discussion over financials, mentions an expansion of the \u201cstrategic relationship\u201d between the Korean technology company and Qualcomm\u2019s product division. Details are again limited, but it includes wording that can give us clues. Qualcomm President Cristiano Amon says the new agreement will be \u201cdriving core mobile technology into many different segments.\u201d This might include the use of Snapdragon processors in more of Samsung\u2019s smartphones, a new family of Samsung Windows 10 PCs using Snapdragon hardware, or even something surrounding process technology and foundry agreements.

{"tick": "AAPL", "author": "Caroline Baum", "text": "Published: Inflation fears were blamed, but then bond prices flipped that story on its head By Before Friday\u2019s stock market rout, which pales in comparison to Monday\u2019s biggest point-decline ever, everything was coming up roses for the U.S. economy. Synchronized global growth, low inflation, solid job creation, a strong sense of optimism among businesses and consumers, robust corporate earnings, aided and abetted by the recently enacted tax cut: What\u2019s not to like? All that changed Friday with a single statistic in a single economic report that fanned \u201cinflation concerns\u201d and triggered a synchronous stock and bond market selloff, at least according to press reports. Monday\u2019s 1,175-point, 4.6% dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average was accompanied by a huge rally in Treasuries, more than erasing Friday\u2019s losses. \u201cInflation concerns\u201d clearly took a back seat to \u2014 let me guess \u2014 flight-to-quality buying? The price action in markets drives perceptions about the economy. But reality doesn\u2019t change nearly as quickly, which is why simplistic explanations often vanish with the next day\u2019s price action. Let\u2019s take a look at a case in point.  featured a story, \u201cTech Giants Power to New Heights,\u201d detailing \u201crecord quarterly financial results\u201d reported by Apple Inc. , Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. on Thursday. By Friday evening, following the Dow\u2019s devilish 666-point decline, those stellar results were now \u201cmixed,\u201d which provided readers a link to the earlier, seemingly contradictory story on the tech giants\u2019 record quarter. What changed? Perceptions, as viewed through the filter of the stock market: that\u2019s what. While it is true that the U.S. stock market has been overvalued for some time, based on metrics such as all it took was a two-day selloff to cast a shroud over weeks of optimism and price appreciation. To be sure, warnings about a bubble in equities, and even bonds, have been a standard feature of TV commercials (buy gold!) and analysts\u2019 reports for years. What set things in motion Friday, according to press reports, was news that had increased 2.9% in January from the prior year, just one of the data points in the monthly employment report. The increase represented the strongest wage growth since 2009. For years we have heard chronic complaints about stagnant wage growth from politicians and the public. And for years, the Fed has been fretting over its failure to hit finding some reason, transitory or idiosyncratic, to explain the chronic undershoot. All of a sudden, when wages show some sign of life, suggesting the labor market is tight enough, and demand for goods and services strong enough, for employers to offer higher wages to attract workers, that\u2019s a cause for alarm? When pressed, Fed policy makers have made it clear that a 2% annual increase in the personal consumption expenditures price index is not a ceiling. The Fed is even considering \u201cpotential alternate frameworks for the conduct of monetary policy,\u201d including price-level targeting, which would entail tolerating inflation in excess of 2% to offset the persistent undershoot, according to It sounds nice in theory, but I\u2019m not sure , given the \u201cinflation concerns\u201d fanned by Friday\u2019s report of rising wages. It was those fears that reportedly drove the yield on to a four-year high of 2.85% on Friday. Just to put things in perspective, 10-year yields are about 50 basis points higher than they were when the Fed\u2019s federal funds target rate was 125 basis points lower in December 2015. An increase in , not inflation expectations, has been the main driver of rising yields since the start of the year. If yields are rising because of stronger growth, that\u2019s a good sign, not a bad sign. So what about the rise in , the other key component of nominal bond yields? The Fed has been worrying that inflation expectations are too low, depressing actual inflation. Again, the Fed\u2019s goals are realized, and that\u2019s a reason to rewrite the script? Stocks have gone up so far so fast that a two-day, 8.5% decline in the Dow was enough to put fear in the hearts of investors and alter the backdrop of strong economic growth? Remember Black Monday, Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow fell 508 points, a loss of 23%? That was a big deal. Besides, if you are looking for early signs of a pick-up in inflation, don\u2019t let wages guide you. Prices lead wages, not the other way around. to deflate the notion of cost-push inflation decades ago, but the idea that costs push prices up keeps coming back. Besides, cries out for a new story. Inflation concerns are so, well, last week. My money is on investors fleeing stocks for the safety and security of U.S. Treasuries. That should work for a few days, at least until the need to fund the government and raise the debt ceiling reminds investors of the Treasury\u2019s massive borrowing needs this year.

{"tick": "AAPL", "author": "Tomi Kilgore, Jacob Passy", "text": "Published: For most companies, mum\u2019s the word By The movement to address the widespread prevalence of sexual harassment and even assault is creeping into the boardrooms of prominent corporations \u2014 but it\u2019s not clear yet whether companies are updating their policies when it comes to dealing with such claims. The #MeToo movement was sparked last fall after bombshell reports in the New Yorker and the New York Times disclosed . Since then, similar allegations have brought down numerous men in the entertainment industry, from to \u201cToday\u201d anchor . This trend has not left corporate America unscathed. Even before the Weinstein allegations came to light, claims of sexual harassment . More recently, Wynn Resorts Ltd. Chief Executive and Chairman Steve Wynn after facing scrutiny of pressuring female employees to perform sex acts. Those claims have prompted investigations by gaming regulators in Massachusetts and Nevada. The Massachusetts Gaming Commission revealed that Wynn Resorts paid to a woman who claimed that Steve Wynn forced her to have sex with him.    The way in which Wynn Resorts handled the sexual-assault allegations lobbed at its founder is not atypical of corporate America. Many companies follow similar protocols in mediating such disputes, said Brian Kropp, who leads the human-resources practice at the consulting firm Gartner. \u201cWith some companies, their playbook on how to respond to claims of sexual harassment is 30 years old,\u201d Kropp said. To this day, many companies will handle such allegations by having human resources perform an internal investigation. If the claims look to be true, the victim will get some sort of financial payout, while the harasser will be reprimanded \u2014 or fired, if the allegations are particularly egregious. However, the deliberations are for the most part kept under wraps. \u201cThey want to minimize risk and exposure for the company,\u201d Kropp said. \u201cThat mind-set still permeates how a lot of organizations are approaching sexual harassment today.\u201d Some companies have chosen a newer approach \u2014 one that gets to the core of the company\u2019s culture. In these instances, the companies are instilling a sense of equity across the organization. That includes measures that ensure equal pay and efforts to promote more women and people from other underrepresented groups, Kropp said. \u201cIt\u2019s thinking about all the systems within a company that create a perception of unfairness,\u201d he said. \u201cSo rather than trying to manage risk, they are creating a culture where it\u2019s not allowed.\u201d    So what decisions to this end are being made in the boardrooms of the 30 companies that form the Dow Jones Industrial Average ? It\u2019s tough to say. MarketWatch reached out to all 30 companies, asking them to comment on whether they\u2019ve updated their policies related to sexual-harassment claims in light of recent events. Only nine companies provided a response \u2014 in previous iterations in which we asked about the tax overhaul and blockchain technology the number of responses stretched into the double digits. The lack of response shouldn\u2019t be surprising though, Kropp said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to respond to questions about what they do or don\u2019t do because every response that\u2019s out there is discoverable if a lawsuit occurs,\u201d he said. Here is what the companies that have responded have had to say:     said that any inappropriate behavior that violates the company\u2019s goals related to mutual respect will not be tolerated, even if the actions aren\u2019t illegal. \u201cEmployees at every level are required to report any behavior that would interfere with a fair and respectful workplace, and complaints are investigated promptly,\u201d the company said. Employee concerns can be raised to leadership and human resources or through 3M\u2019s reporting system, which provides the option to remain anonymous.     said that sexual harassment in the workplace isn\u2019t tolerated and that reports of sexual harassment are investigated. The company further reviews policies relating to harassment \u201cin a timely manner and update them as needed,\u201d it said.     said it continuously looks at its already strong policies, with every allegation vigorously investigated. The company\u2019s indicate that Apple will not \u201ctolerate discrimination or harassment of employees or non-employees with whom we have a business, service, or professional relationship.\u201d     described itself as \u201ca values-based company\u201d in a statement. The company trains all employees on its code of conduct, which includes \u201crobust anti-harassment policies,\u201d on an annual basis, it said.     has not updated policies related to sexual harassment in reaction to recent events, but a company spokesman said that the company reviews and updates policies \u201calmost annually\u201d to meet changes in the law and in best practices. \u201cWe reissued our policy recently as part of our standard practice. In light of recent events,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cWe also reminded all employees of our policy and of our leadership\u2019s commitment to that policy.\u201d     said it does not tolerate sexual harassment. The company has open reporting channels and encourages employees to come forward through them if they have been subject to inappropriate conduct. Those allegations are then \u201cimpartially investigated,\u201d and \u201cswift disciplinary action\u201d will occur as needed. The company\u2019s general counsel recently sent a memo to all employees reiterating the company\u2019s zero-tolerance policy and its transparency in handling these matters.     also said it has a zero-tolerance policy for \u201canyone who violates our value of respect for all people,\u201d a company spokesman said.

{"tick": "AAPL", "author": "Claudia Assis", "text": "Published: Whether bracing for delays or hoping for none, Wall Street is keeping production of the sedan firmly in its sights By Wall Street is starting to sound like a broken record when it comes to Tesla Inc., but until the Silicon Valley car maker finds its groove, there\u2019s only one thing that matters. Yes, the Model 3. Tesla is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results after the bell on Wednesday, and investors are sure to parse every word the company utters about the Model 3 production ramp. \u201cOur concern has been really the same since September,\u201d said David Kudla, Chief Executive of Mainstay Capital Management. \u201cIt\u2019s the Model 3 and production delays that continue to be delayed even further. Are they going to delay again, or are they going to make progress?\u201d Tesla recently filed to do its first asset-backed securities deal, and the company has moved to quash renewed concerns about its production.    Meanwhile, its stock performance continues to outperform benchmarks and competitors, even though the company is expected to report a wider loss for the quarter. Tesla shorts, or those investors betting the stock will turn lower, have lost about $1.3 billion so far this year, according to recent data from financial analytics firm S3.       Analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Tesla to report an adjusted loss of $3.11 a share in the quarter, compared with an adjusted loss of 69 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 2016. Estimize, a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from Wall Street analysts as well as buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, company executives, academics and others, has also projected an adjusted loss of $3.11 a share.  The FactSet revenue consensus is $3.3 billion, which would be up from $2.3 billion in the same quarter last year. Estimize has the same consensus.  Tesla\u2019s stock has gained more than 35% in the past 12 months, which compares with gains of around 20% for the S&P 500 index and 26% for the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  It also leaves in the dust the stock of competitor General Motors Co. which has gained 13% in the same period. Tesla stock gains contrast with losses of more than 15% for Ford Motor Co. stock.       Chief Executive Elon Musk has taken to twitter to , the company he started with the aim of boring underground tunnels to ease traffic congestion: Flamethrowers. \u201cI\u2019m the first to admit Musk is a genius,\u201d but it is unclear whether making money is his goal for Tesla, Mainstay\u2019s Kudla said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening with the manufacturing process,\u201d he said, adding that he has shorted Tesla in the past year and made profits. There will always be people who love Tesla like they love Apple Inc. and will give the company and its CEO pass after pass but for its products and cachet. But ultimately, the company has to make money to be taken seriously,\u201d he said. Tesla and Musk recently , including growing to a market capitalization of $650 billion, more than 10 times the company\u2019s current market value. The announcement could have alleviated \u201crising concerns over key man risk,\u201d analysts at Nomura said in a recent note, as the new plan requires Musk to remain CEO or serve as both executive chairman and chief product officer in order for stock-vesting schedules to trigger. Tesla in early January That goal post, first set for 2017, then for the first quarter of 2018, has been moved to the second quarter of the year. The fourth-quarter report will be a \u201cde-risking event\u201d as Model 3 production continues to ramp, analysts at Baird said in a note Tuesday. \u201cWe are buyers ahead of (fourth-quarter results,\u201d they said. \u201cWe believe (Tesla\u2019s) recent decision to push out production targets has de-risked the stock, and the Q4 report could remove another overhang. Positive reviews of the Model 3 are likely to coincide with more deliveries to non-employees, which should strengthen demand and drive company shares higher, the analysts said. Tesla can fund the Model 3 ramp without raising additional capital, but a capital raise would remove an additional overhang, they said. Baird analysts updated their calls for 2018, saying they expect an adjusted loss of $1.57 a share for the year, which compares with FactSet consensus for an adjusted loss of $4.16.

{"tick": "AAPL", "author": "Kari Paul", "text": "Published: Should apps contain privacy warnings similar to nutritional labels on food? By Soldiers using fitness tracking devices inadvertently revealed the locations of U.S. military bases \u2014 including classified ones \u2014 and the incident has lessons for anyone with a smartphone. The locations of several U.S. military bases through data from Strava, a San Francisco-based GPS tracking company, representing a \u201cclear security threat,\u201d according to one security analyst, the Washington Post reported. The Strava app is used with phones and popular devices like Jawbone, Fitbit and Vitofit. Its public \u201cheat maps,\u201d which show where there is high concentration of activity, revealed locations where troops were using it to train in Somalia, Niger, Syria and Afghanistan. Military bases aren\u2019t the only locations at risk of being exposed, a Feb. 7 study from mobile security firm found. It showed a security flaw in Strava\u2019s privacy zone feature that can triangulate the exact home address of users. Strava\u2019s \u201cprivacy zone\u201d tool lets users stop the app from tracking their activities around a specific address, presumably their home or workplace. Wandera researchers found that it\u2019s possible to triangulate the exact location of a person\u2019s address using the end points of users\u2019 activities. Strava did respond to requests for comment regarding either of these security breaches. These issues have underscored the importance of companies clearly explaining to consumers what data is shared on apps, said Mark Testoni, chief executive officer and president of in Virginia. He said there should be labels on apps regarding privacy, similar to nutritional labels on food.    Fitness tracking companies can pinpoint where people live, how often they sleep, and even when they are engaged in sexual activity based on data collected, said Mark Weinstein, a privacy advocate and chief executive officer of social network . Allowing apps to access photos is perhaps the most egregious permission, said George Avetisov, chief executive officer at HYPR, a security company . Apps use facial recognition technology and, in theory, can track you and who you spend time with. Case in point: Uber\u2019s \u201cGod view\u201d display the movements of specific users. The company reportedly used the tool as a \u201cparty trick,\u201d showing guests at a launch party a screen that showed all rides happening at a given time. An Uber executive also admitted to tracking the rider logs of a BuzzFeed News reporter. following these reports, the company a $20,000 fine. Testoni said there should be labels on apps regarding privacy, similar to nutritional labels on food. \u201cWe do not want to put people in harm\u2019s way,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to look at this through a public policy perspective and make consumers more aware of the data being collected on us daily.\u201d Such a measure could be far away, experts say. In April 2017, Congress approved a reversal of protections implemented under the Obama administration that prevented internet service providers from collecting data from users. Now, corporations are to track user habits. Here are some measures to minimize risk of sharing sensitive information:   If you gloss over terms of service after downloading an app, you aren\u2019t alone: 91% of users accept legal terms and conditions without reading them, one from U.K. tax services company Deloitte found. This is a dangerous habit and an easy way to sign away your privacy, Weinstein said. \u201cScan them and look for things that jump out like location services,\u201d he said.   Within the terms of service on apps \u2014 often on a separate prompt screen \u2014 companies ask users permission to access features beyond location, including microphone, photos, camera, and contacts. Weinstein said to deny access to as many of these as possible, especially if the app is from a small or unknown company. Some apps allow users to enable microphone and other features only while using it, which decreases the amount of data collected at other times. That would be a wise move, Avetisov said. \u201cAre these apps pulling this data maliciously? The truth is that most app users are allowing this data to be used the moment that approve the app\u2019s permission settings,\u201d he said.   Although convenient, signing into apps with existing accounts on Google or Facebook puts users at higher risk for hacking and provides more data to those companies to track and sell, Mark Weinstein said. Make a separate log in and password for every single account, and use a password manager to keep track of them.   If you\u2019re not using your app to hail a ride or find a restaurant, consider turning off location settings completely. On Apple devices, users can go to \u201csettings,\u201d \u201cprivacy.\u201d It will cut down on tracking and save battery power. For Android devices, \u201d \u201clocation,\u201d \u201cGoogle location settings.\u201d That simple maneuver would have helped those U.S. military personnel protect their location.
