In a Thursday report, S&P Global Ratings warned investors that \u201cthe technology sector may never look the same again,\u201d now that the U.S. tax overhaul will allow for tech giants to bring back billions of dollars from overseas coffers. While viewed as an overall positive, it could also result in more fast and loose financial policies that could damage creditworthiness in the sector. Earlier in the week, on signs of weakening earnings. S&P said it believes \u201cthe overall industry credit profile will weaken over time, largely because of the potential for more aggressive financial policies in response to greater access to overseas cash.\u201d Resulting lower cash balances will result in weaker credit metrics ultimately, S&P said, and those aggressive financial policies appear to be key. S&P noted: \u201cIf an issuer adopts a more aggressive financial policy than we expect after repatriation, likely through additional share repurchases, its credit metrics could deteriorate based upon our policy of netting surplus cash against debt, potentially leading to rating or outlook revisions. Generally, we will not deduct surplus cash from debt if a company is (1) owned by a financial sponsor as defined in our criteria, or (2) has a business risk profile at the lower end of the scale (i.e., weak or vulnerable as described in our criteria).\u201d S&P points to \u2019s recent announcement that it plans to go from having and said the tech giant could be a trend setter for the industry.    \u201cWe anticipate that other large cash holders will also announce enhanced shareholder returns over time,\u201d S&P said. Topping that list along with Apple is the only AAA-rated tech issue  along with     and   Then, there are those companies who have as much about as much debt as they have cash to repatriate. Should those companies use the repatriated cash to return to shareholders and still hold on to the debt, that could be harmful to their rating.    S&P noted: Unlike issuers with large net cash positions, we believe those that have both high cash and debt balances face potential credit risks because they may choose to use substantial portions of now-accessible foreign cash for shareholder returns. These issuers, some of which have modest net cash positions or are in net debt positions, will have to manage a delicate balance between equity holders and debtholders. Depletion of cash, if not offset by some debt reduction, can raise leverage by our calculation and lead us to consider a downgrade. S&P used Oracle as an example, pointing out that while it has $72 billion in cash, about 35% of its market cap, it also has $61 billion in debt so its net cash is relatively low, at about 5% of market cap. Other companies in this boat include    and  S&P said. \u201cWe believe companies with these types of balance sheets will have to clarify their financial policies to both equity and bond investors over the coming quarters as cash comes back on shore,\u201d according to S&P. Tech companies that have seen their stocks underperform over the past year or so are particularly vulnerable, because there\u2019s more incentive to return money to shareholders to boost stock prices. S&P said: We are very attentive to the repatriation-related earnings call comments from issuers whose share prices have underperformed the overall market during the past year. Issuers with meaningful cash balances offshore are likely engaged in deep board-level discussions to finalize their capital allocation strategies and we have already heard from some management commenting about \u201creturn of excess capital\u201d to shareholders. We believe that management of companies whose share prices have lagged the market will feel greater pressure to appease the shareholders through aggressive share repurchases or risky acquisitions. One example S&P used was  Over the past 12 months, shares of Juniper have declined 8%, compared with the 15% gain in the S&P 500 index and the 22% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index  On the other hand, companies like  and  which are up 90% and 70%, respectively, over the past 12 months, will have a lot more flexibility with the timing a size of shareholder returns and will likely be better able to balance stock and bondholder needs, S&P said.

The creation of dynamic content and high-end visuals has enabled the biotech, medical devices, and pharmaceutical industries to exploit the benefits of 3D animation. Animation is being used for maximizing sales, as it enables providers to emphasize and focus on the benefits of products and services by delivering an engaging, educational, and entertaining experience to the viewers.  The increasing use of 3D animation technologies is expected to influence the end-use industries positively. In case of medical science, 3D animation techniques are one of the most effective ways for communication as they display the human body in a polygonal form, which cannot be replicated using photography, sketch, and two-dimensional illustrations.  Traditionally concentrated in the developed countries, the 3D animation market has paved its way into the emerging countries such as India, China, and the Philippines owing to the increasing trend of outsourcing animation activities to these countries. In 2016, the North American region accounted for the largest revenue share of the 3D animation market. However, the Asia Pacific region is expected to witness robust growth throughout the forecast period.    \u2022 The 3D modeling segment is expected to account for the largest revenue share by 2025 and register an estimated CAGR of around 10% over the forecast period \u2022 The visual effects segment was valued at around USD 2.1 billion in 2016, primarily attributed to the increased demand from the media & entertainment industry \u2022 By 2025, the media & entertainment end-use segment is projected to account for around 35% of the total revenue share \u2022 In 2016, the North American region accounted for the largest revenue share and is anticipated to retain its dominance throughout the forecast period \u2022 Asia Pacific is projected to emerge as the fastest growing market since there is a growing emphasis on producing local animated content apart from the outsourced assignments performed by regional firms \u2022 The key players in the industry include Autodesk, Inc., Corel Corporation, Zco Corporation, Adobe Systems Incorporated, NVIDIA Corporation, and NewTek, Inc.

RDI Initiates Coverage on: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.   NVIDIA Corporation   Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. shares closed down 3.57% on Thursday with about 67.5 million shares traded. The company recently reported stronger than expected fourth quarter financial results which showed a 60% growth in revenue in its computer and graphics business. Revenue soared 34% in total to $1.48 billion. Full year revenue came in at $5.33 billion. The company's CEO Lisa Su said, \"2017 marked a key product and financial inflection point for AMD. Our newest wave of high-performance products and consistent execution created significant momentum for our business over the past year.\" So why the drop yesterday? Shares may be feeling the burn as its rival NVIDIA was removed from Goldman Sach's Conviction List because an analyst has cited concerns over the volatility of cryptocurrency. Access RDI's Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Research Report at:   NVIDIA Corporation shares closed down 2.16% on Thursday on nearly 13 million shares traded. Traders showed some worry over Goldman Sachs removing the company from its conviction list. Analyst Toshiya Hari of the firm has removed the company from the list but has still maintained his \"buy\" rating on the stock and increased the price target to $281 from $228.. According to the analyst, \"Nvidia shares have simply come too far to warrant a spot on the Conviction List.\" He also cited concerns over NVIDIA's digital currency business. He wrote in a note to clients, \"While we continue to see meaningful upside to FY2019/2020 estimates and maintain our Buy rating, we believe a) the long-term secular growth angle in data center is now better understood and b) near-term dynamics in cryptocurrency demand may lead to increased earnings volatility.\" He also noted, \"While the increase in GPU demand from Ether miners is boosting fundamentals in the near-term, increased exposure to the Crypto market will, in our view, increase uncertainty and volatility, which are typically dilutive to valuation multiples.\" Shares of NVIDIA have gained 115 percent over the last 12 months.

The analysts of the report have identified NVIDIA Corporation and INTEL Corporation as the top two companies who were ahead of the curve in 2016, whereas Google Inc., Qualcomm Incorporated, IBM Corporation, CEVA Inc., Xilinx, Graphcore, Teradeep Inc., and Advanced Micro Devices are some of the other notable companies currently harnessing the prospects of deep learning.   Since the entry barriers of this market are not incredibly high and heavily dependent on technologies that are not patented, startups have a strong chance to make a mark. In the near future, the shares in the global deep learning chipset are expected to head towards a fragmented scenario, although most of the prominent chip manufacturers are anticipated to hold onto their position of strength. Market leaders are expected to frequently indulge into acquisition and collaboration activities with startups with niche concepts. For instance, in January 2016, Google Inc. agreed to collaborate with Movidius to enhance its deep learning portfolio on mobile devices, which was later acquired by Intel Corporation. Later in August the same year, Intel Corporation also acquired Nervana Systems in order to further solidify its position in developing the hardware chipsets platform.     If the projections of the TMR report are to be believed, the demand in the global deep learning chipset market will increment at a phenomenal CAGR of 24.7% during the forecast period of 2017 to 2025. The report has estimated that from its calculated worth of merely US$150.17 mn in 2015, the opportunities in the global deep learning market will translate into a revenue of US$1,264.78 mn by the end of 2025. Based on type, the TMR report segments the global deep learning chipset market into application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and others. Compute capacity bifurcation of the market has been done into low (less than 1 TFlops) and high (greater than 1 TFlops). End-user classification of the market has been done into automotive, consumer electronics, healthcare, industrial, aerospace and defense, and others. Geographically, the analysts have detected that although North America currently provides for the maximum chunk of demand, the region of Asia Pacific will overtake in terms of demand and revenue by the end of 2025.      The global deep learning chipset market is primarily driven by significant improvements in the chip algorithms in the last few year, which has enormously increased their ability to consume and manage data efficiently. With increasing adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) that promises to connect billions of new devices and pertaining data streams, it is very likely that much more digital data will be generated and consequently, the industry of machine learning and deep learning will flourish. Moreover, newly build algorithms are shifting the learning from one particular application to another application, making it easily possible for the machines to learn from very fewer examples. Invention of a related computer chip, which is known as GPU or graphic processing unit, is turning out to be very meaningful and effective when it is being applied to types of calculations required for neural nets. Speed up of 10x times are also very much viable when the neural nets will move from traditional CPU to GPU.

{"link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-the-big-blunder-that-many-average-investors-are-committing-now-2018-02-08", "source": "https://www.marketwatch.com/", "text": "Published: Bond funds offer no safety from the stock market\u2019s decline By Many average investors are committing a blunder now. It\u2019s not all their fault, though, as information is often dumbed down in the interest of simplicity. As Einstein said: \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler.\u201d Unfortunately, often the information provided to average investors has been simplified below the bare minimum. To avoid the blunder, average investors need a bit of sophistication. To fully understand how to avoid the blunder, let us first start with a chart that illustrates the point. Read on for the blunder and how to avoid it.   Please click for the chart of iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF Please observe the following important points on the chart: \u2022 The chart shows that TLT has fallen about 18% from its recent peak. \u2022 An average investor who bought near the peak to collect about 2.75% interest has now lost about 18% of the principal. \u2022 If interest rates normalize even to the recent low levels, an average investor who bought near the peak will lose 42% of the principal.         Many average investors believe the myth that bonds are safe. There is some truth to the understanding that bonds are safer than stocks, but average investors miss an important nuance. If you buy an individual Treasury bond or a bond of a company with a solid balance sheet and hold it to maturity, you will get your principal back. However, this is not the case when you buy mutual funds or ETFs.   Many average investors are advised to start with 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds. Of course, adjustments are made based on age and objectives. Investors are told that stocks are for growth and bonds are for safety and income. Many average investors do not understand that they can lose a lot of money in bonds.   Bonds have been in a 30-year bull market. For this reason, the bad advice given to investors has not hurt them so far. However, average investors need to know that the bull market has ended.   As stock market volatility has risen, many average investors who want safety are moving out of stocks into bonds. They are doing so because they do not understand the following: \u2022 They can lose money in bonds, as illustrated in the chart linked above. \u2022 Interest rates are rising. \u2022 Bonds move inverse to interest rates. In plain English, when interest rates go higher, bonds go lower. \u2022 Stocks are experiencing volatility because of rising interest rates.   First and foremost, do not buy bond funds or ETFs. Second, understand that most funds and popular ETFs are concentrated in a handful of stocks that have run up and now pose a high risk. For example, the top holdings of popular ETF are Apple Microsoft and Facebook Alphabet  is right there too. These are also the top holdings of popular ETF along with Nvidia Netflix and Qualcomm  The point is that many investors are overly concentrated in technology stocks.

Though not Nvidia\u2019s largest business, the server segment is its fastest-growing. Revenue , to $606 million, ahead of the FactSet consensus estimate for 85% growth. That\u2019s one big reason why Nvidia shares gained in Friday morning trading. \u201cWe believe this dynamic demonstrates consistent demand for Nvidia\u2019s leading-edge data center products, driving [average selling price] and margin strength,\u201d wrote Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer. He noted that the company\u2019s V100 product already has a number of high-profile adopters, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , Amazon.com Inc. Alphabet Inc.  , Baidu Inc. International Business Machines Corp. Microsoft Corp. Oracle Corp. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. Schafer has a perform rating on Nvidia shares.   Raymond James analyst Chris Caso is also optimistic about Nvidia\u2019s data-center business, pointing out that sales of Volta GPUs are still ramping up. \u201cWith only two cloud customers on Volta, the rest are still deploying Pascal-related boards, suggesting another strong leg up is yet to come in that market,\u201d he wrote. Caso added that the data-center business is likely the major factor behind Nvidia\u2019s big rally over the past year, with shares up 95% in that time versus a 12% gain for the S&P 500 and a 27% rise for the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index  \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019re anywhere near the end of the Volta product cycle,\u201d he wrote, while maintaining an outperform rating. \u201cThe stock\u2019s valuation is of course high, but as long as the company keeps putting up quarters like this, and with future potential catalysts from auto and inferencing ahead, we believe shares will continue to move higher.\u201d Nvidia\u2019s automotive business , but analysts seemed nonetheless optimistic about that segment going forward. \u201cConcern over [whether] Nvidia can maintain the momentum fails to recognize an additional autonomous vehicle tailwind ramping significantly in FY20,\u201d wrote Needham\u2019s Rajvindra Gill, who has a buy rating on the stock. He raised his target price to $300 from $250. Cryptocurrency-related revenue delivered a nice boost to Nvidia\u2019s results during the latest quarter, given that its . With Ethereum prices down sharply, however, there\u2019s some debate over the potential impact of this business on Nvidia\u2019s results in the future. In a note titled \u201cLove the Data Center... Hate the Crypto,\u201d Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland dubbed sales of GPUs for Ethereum mining a \u201clong-term negative\u201d for Nvidia. He noted that the company issued a strong forecast for its fiscal first quarter, which ends in April, and worries that \u201cpotentially fleeting crypto GPU sales may set 2Q18 guidance up poorly.\u201d Some analysts from Proof of Work protocol to Proof of Stake protocol in the first half of the year, which could hurt Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Proof of Work requires GPU mining, while Proof of Stake doesn\u2019t. Rolland believes that Ethereum-related sales of GPUs may have exceeded $400 million in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. He has a neutral rating on shares, and he raised his price target to $215 from $200 following the results. Needham\u2019s Gill, who estimates about $140 million in crypto revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter, also warned that \u201chigh crypto mining demand and potential volatility could spill off and cause fluctuations in the Gaming business.\u201d Raymond James\u2019 Caso isn\u2019t concerned when he looks at the overall business. \u201cWhile investors are likely to question the sustainability of recent crypto-driven strength\u2014and its impact on tight supply\u2014management is taking a relatively conservative approach, assuming flat crypto demand in April and highlighting pent-up \u201ctraditional\u201d gaming-driven demand,\u201d he wrote.

{"link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/eye-popping-nvidia-earnings-send-stock-soaring-but-automotive-business-still-stalled-2018-02-08", "source": "https://www.marketwatch.com/", "text": "Published: Opinion: Gaming and server businesses are living up to the hype, but self-driving-car sales are still in the future By Nvidia Corp. reported full-year earnings Thursday that validated the huge increase in its stock price over the past two-plus years, but the final piece of the bull theory is still in neutral until at least later this year. Nvidia\u2019s numbers were eye-popping, especially for a company that has been public for nearly 20 years and experienced an annual sales decline just five years ago. The key numbers for Nvidia\u2019s 2018 fiscal year: , profit increased 83% (yes, that\u2019s GAAP) and gross margin increased by 110 basis points. Those numbers were just part of , which sent shares up more than 7% in late trading. Nvidia stock has already gained 83.4% in the past year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 23.9%, and that rise came on top of the biggest gains on the S&P 500 index in 2016. Nvidia\u2019s ride has been fueled by greater demand for its core product, graphics chips, which have found a home beyond videogames thanks to their usefulness in machine learning. The general bull theory is that Nvidia\u2019s core gaming business will continue to grow thanks to the rise of esports and more graphically-intense videogames, while new businesses selling chips for servers and autonomous cars will eventually be huge. With its fourth-quarter report, Nvidia lived up to two parts of that theory. The core gaming business, which has been boosted by demands for those same chips , grew nearly 36% to more than $5.5 billion in revenue, more than Nvidia\u2019s revenue total in any year before the previous one. The server business, meanwhile, came close to $2 billion in annual revenue, after failing to touch $1 billion the year before and mostly failing to exist before that. The one laggard so far is the automotive business, which declined sequentially in the fourth quarter and grew less than 15% for the full year. The results were below analysts\u2019 average expectations for the second quarter in a row. Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call Thursday that Nvidia automotive sales fell as its ditches a longtime business of providing chips that power in-car systems to next-generation auto supplies. \u201cThe sequential decline reflects our transition from infotainment, which is becoming commoditized, to next-generation AI cockpit systems and complete top-to-bottom self-driving-vehicle platforms built on Nvidia hardware and software,\u201d Kress said. Nvidia , including a focus on and new in-car experiences involving augmented reality. Based on Thursday\u2019s commentary, we may see Nvidia\u2019s auto business struggle a bit before they realize any gains from their plans for the future. The Xavier processor, a chip with 9 billion transistors that Nvidia calls the most complex system-on-a-chip ever created, is expected to eventually drive its automotive business. It will act as the heart of its Nvidia Drive ecosystem, a platform it has developed for car makers to use to create safe self-driving cars. Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told analysts that he believes the really big revenue from automotive will begin in about 2019 to 2020, when auto makers, startups, taxi companies, ride-hailing companies and others begin to order self-driving capabilities in their vehicles and fleets. He revealed that the brains for self-driving cars will sell for an average of about $500 to $1,000, while those for \u201crobo-taxis,\u201d as Nvidia refers to autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, will command several thousand dollars each. The upside for Nvidia\u2019s automotive business is expected to come from software, bigger volumes of its chips and for self-driving cars. Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein Research analyst, wrote in a recent note that he expects growth in automotive \u201cto come from software development agreements related to autonomous driving at some point this year,\u201d he said. Investors who have bought into Nvidia are reaping rewards from gaming, cryptocurrency and a booming server business right now, but the automotive business still needs some gas. If that business is as big as Nvidia has claimed, shares could keep driving higher. Join the conversation Copyright \u00a9 2018 MarketWatch, Inc.  All rights reserved.
