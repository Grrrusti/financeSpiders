{"text": "NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ) investors are enjoying a 6% bounce in shares today after the chip giant delivered outclasses across the board: on Data Center, Gaming, gross margins, and guidance. RBC Capital analyst sings the praises of the chip giant that just \u201c[checked] all the boxes\u201d for the fourth quarter, all while doling out a colossal guidance beat for the first fiscal quarter of 2019. In reaction, the analyst maintains an Outperform rating on NVDA stock while hiking the price target from $250 to $280, which implies a close to 21% upside from current levels. (To watch Steves\u2019 track record, ) \u201cNvidia reported yet another blow our quarter, with Data Center and Gaming both exceeding Buyside numbers. Importantly, the guidance was materially ahead of expectations with most anticipating slight q/q declines and flattish margins VS. flat guide and expanding margins,\u201d highlights Steves. Naming off the best strengths of the print, the analyst points out: \u201cNvidia reported another solid quarter across the board with all major items meeting or exceeding expectations: 1) Data Center growth of 20% or more? (Check, 21.0%); 2) Gaming growth of 5-6% or more? (Check, 11.4%); 3) Gross margins in the 60s? (Check, 62.1%) and 4) Guidance of down 1-3% sequentially? (Check, flat at mid-point with margin expansion). Overall, all of the necessary items were \u2018meet or exceed\u2019 with the most impressive part being the guidance suggesting another material quarter of Data Center growth.\u201d On back of the strength of the quarter, Nvidia\u2019s EPS has been driven up over a $2.00 EPS run-rate one quarter early, cheers the analyst. Steves soars on confidence for the semiconductor player on every point, except for one- only 3% gains in Nvidia\u2019s Auto segment. However, this should be \u201cfixed\u201d once autonomous vehicles get revved up come next year or 2020. Therefore, the analyst wagers shareholders should offer this weaker segment a \u201cpass\u201d through the back half of 2019- as long as the segment continues to indicate stability. For the fourth fiscal quarter of 2018, NVDA realized $2,911.0 million in revenue and $1.72 in EPS, beating out the Street\u2019s $2.66 billion revenue projection and $1.32 non-GAAP EPS forecast. Nvidia meanwhile grew gross margins to 62.1% and operating margins to 41.3%. Revenue segment by segment saw Gaming shoot up 29% year-over-year to $1,739 million; Pro Visualization surged 12.9% year-over-year to $254 million; Data Center rocketed up 104.7% year-over-year to $606 million; leaving Auto growing a slight 3.1% year-over-year to $132 million. \u201cWe continue to be impressed by the data center revenue and believe automotive will continue to grow in CY17 on the back of rising ASPs and new OEM wins,\u201d underscores Steves. For the first fiscal quarter of 2019, the NVDA team sets expectations for $2.90 billion in revenue against the Street\u2019s $2.46 billion, gross margins between 62.5% and 63.5%, $645 million in non-GAAP operating expenses, and a roughly 11% to 13% tax rate. Steves calculates an estimate of $1.65 in EPS, based on the outlook\u2019s midpoint, and notes the company\u2019s revenue guide suggests 50% in revenue gains year-over-year. Currently Nvidia boasts $8.13 per share in net cash, with the analyst betting on around 65% held overseas, poised to take advantage from repatriation. The only factor Nvidia deems a challenge to calculate is crypto currency revenue; yet, Steves quantifies $70 million for the last quarter and around $180 million for the current quarter. reveals a positive, yet cautious analyst consensus surveying the chip giant\u2019s opportunity in the market. Based on 22 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 10 rate a Buy on Nvidia stock, 11 maintain a Hold, while 1 issues a Sell on the stock. Notably, the 12-month average price target of $230.95 suggests 6% in return potential for Nvidia shares- in other words, these analysts\u2019 expectations reflect optimism.", "link": "https://www.smarteranalyst.com/2018/02/09/rally-heres-nvidia-corporation-stock-another-17-go/", "source": "MarketWatch", "author": null, "tick": "NVDA", "headline": "Rally on!

Investors and traders are often forced to sell their strongest holdings in falling markets to compensate for losses taken in their weakest plays. This long-observed feedback loop can drop the strongest issues to multi-month lows before interested buyers gather the funds needed to start fresh uptrends. (See also: .) The company came public at a $1.83 in January 1999 and eased into a trading range between $1.33 and $2.37. It broke out in the fourth quarter, entering a trend advance at the same time the neared its historic climax. NVIDIA shares topped out at $14.67 in June 2000 and outperformed the broad market for the next 18 months, hitting a new high at $24.22 in January 2002. Sellers then took control, dropping the stock to a three-year low in the deep single digits. A strong uptrend through mid-decade ended 15 points above the 2002 high in 2007, giving way to a decline that held up relatively well during the 2008 . The stock posted a four-year low at $5.75 and bounced into the new decade, stalling at the .618 in 2011.

The indicator crossed to the bear side at the start of 2018, normally predicting six to nine months of relative weakness, but the stock has not\u00a0dropped to the level since 2011. While this highlights unusual strength in recent years, it also predicts that will eventually take control, generating a steep decline. (For more, see: .) The stock entered a powerful in August 2015, lifting above the 2011 peak (red line) at the end of 2016. It has continued to post new highs into 2018, indicating strong institutional sponsorship that should limit selling pressure during a correction. The indicator breakout line could be useful if the stock heads for lower ground, with hidden at that level likely to attract strong buying interest. Price action eased into a rising channel in June 2017, tracking logarithmic price scale more reliably than arithmetic price scale. It rallied into channel for the third time in January 2018, posting an all-time high at $249.27 and selling off with the broad market, dropping 45 points into this week's low at $204. A bounce through mid-week stalled at the .618 sell-off retracement, while Thursday's post-market advance ended near that level. This price action tells informed market players to watch the tape between $233 and $240, looking for sellers to reload positions. A rally above $240 will indicate bullish strength that may support a at the late January high.

{"text": "Published: LONDON, Jan. 30, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Download the full report:        Growing applications of animation in the media & entertainment, healthcare & life sciences, manufacturing, and education & academics industries is expected to drive the market significantly.  The creation of dynamic content and high-end visuals has enabled the biotech, medical devices, and pharmaceutical industries to exploit the benefits of 3D animation. Animation is being used for maximizing sales, as it enables providers to emphasize and focus on the benefits of products and services by delivering an engaging, educational, and entertaining experience to the viewers.  The increasing use of 3D animation technologies is expected to influence the end-use industries positively. In case of medical science, 3D animation techniques are one of the most effective ways for communication as they display the human body in a polygonal form, which cannot be replicated using photography, sketch, and two-dimensional illustrations.  Traditionally concentrated in the developed countries, the 3D animation market has paved its way into the emerging countries such as India, China, and the Philippines owing to the increasing trend of outsourcing animation activities to these countries. In 2016, the North American region accounted for the largest revenue share of the 3D animation market. However, the Asia Pacific region is expected to witness robust growth throughout the forecast period.    \u2022 The 3D modeling segment is expected to account for the largest revenue share by 2025 and register an estimated CAGR of around 10% over the forecast period \u2022 The visual effects segment was valued at around USD 2.1 billion in 2016, primarily attributed to the increased demand from the media & entertainment industry \u2022 By 2025, the media & entertainment end-use segment is projected to account for around 35% of the total revenue share \u2022 In 2016, the North American region accounted for the largest revenue share and is anticipated to retain its dominance throughout the forecast period \u2022 Asia Pacific is projected to emerge as the fastest growing market since there is a growing emphasis on producing local animated content apart from the outsourced assignments performed by regional firms \u2022 The key players in the industry include Autodesk, Inc., Corel Corporation, Zco Corporation, Adobe Systems Incorporated, NVIDIA Corporation, and NewTek, Inc.

Zacks Equity Research     Following its second quadruple-digit loss in the past 3 days, the Dow Jones Industrial Average now looks to be up 200 points going into the final trading day\u2019s open for the week. It\u2019s a week, anecdotally, that is on pace to perform the worst since August 2011, when the U.S. credit rating had been downgraded from AAA by Standard & Poor\u2019s for the first time since World War II. The next leg down on the Dow Thursday helped force international markets into the red while we were sleeping. The Nikkei fell another 2.3%, where the FTSE 100 in Europe has seen a weekly sell-off of 4.4%. But after-the-bell earnings reports from companies like NVIDIA\u00a0(   )\t, Skechers\u00a0(   )\t\u00a0and Activision\u00a0(   )\t\u00a0Thursday afternoon helped tie the domestic market indexes back to earnings strength reality. Should we be looking at other reasons for the recent volatility in the market, we\u2019re seeing bases being covered, at least for now. Part of the initial hysteria in the sell-off that got heavy a week ago was that wage growth was going to lead to inflation, which was going to lead to increased interest rate hikes by the Fed. Yesterday, Kansas City Fed Chair Esther George said the already expected 3 interest rate hikes in 2018 is still a solid benchmark. Also, should perceived instability in Washington DC play a role in investor shakiness this week, Congress yesterday approved a 2-year budget deal that brought a quick end to the second shutdown of the U.S. government in the past month. A bipartisan agreement worth $400 billion passed in the middle of the night last night (actually very early this morning), which will allow lawmakers to focus on other things, for now. So there we have it. As of this minute, it would appear we\u2019ll be avoiding the worst single week in Dow trading since the collapse of the U.S. economy in October 2008. Then again, it\u2019s still very early. Happy Friday! Our experts cut down 220 Zacks Rank #1 Strong Buys to the 7 that are most likely to jump in price immediately.

{"text": "Find the best broker for your trading or investing needs Coming off of one of the most turbulent weeks in recent history for the global market, with tech stocks as some of the hardest hit, one play has raked in major gains for its investors.

{"text": "Menu Source: Shutterstock Even if you\u2019re completely disinterested in financial markets, you\u2019ve undoubtedly heard of the crash. At the start of this week, the Dow Jones announced its entry with a 4.6% loss. On an intraday basis, the benchmark index suffered the single-worst point loss in its history. Given this backdrop, investors are thinking about stocks to sell, not stocks to buy. Wall Street jitters were further compounded because no one could explain why the Dow Jones dropped so precipitously. During the epicenter on Monday, \u2019s contacted the New York Stock Exchange to inquire about what happened. Was it a \u201cfat finger\u201d incident? Did Skynet become self-aware (say it in an Austrian accent for maximum effect) and deliberately crash the markets? It turned out that nothing was out of the ordinary. Such news led J.P. Morgan\u2019s Dubravko Lakos-Bujas to say \u201cWe see the market selloff entirely disconnected from fundamentals.\u201d But if no technical or suspect behavior sparked the Dow Jones crash, can we immediately cross off the fundamentals? This ambiguity shifts investor sentiment towards defensive strategies, not stocks to buy. But in my opinion, events like this Dow Jones crash are the perfect time to buy strong companies on discount. I did exactly that when I bought (NYSE: ) shares post-Great Recession. At the time, no one was talking about stocks to buy, let alone stocks. Today, those shares have jumped four-fold, and Japan is quite possibly on the upswing. So rather than going completely defensive, try some offense as well. Here are seven blue-chip stocks to buy amid this record-breaking selloff. If you\u2019re looking for a great discount that is also a stable opportunity, consider (NYSE: ). HD stock was looking mighty frothy. However, the broader market correction chopped it down quite nicely. I\u2019m expecting a little bit more of a hit, down between $160 and $170. If it gets there, buy! As a secular retail play, I absolutely HD stock. I don\u2019t care if we have a recession, depression, or succession: if something goes wrong with your home (and it\u2019s fixable), you go straight to Home Depot. That means the company\u2019s consumer base is all-inclusive. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a rugged everyman or a Millennial who can\u2019t tell the difference between a Philips head screwdriver and a tampon; you need HD. Now, the risk factor is housing, and the markets reaction to it. Currently, are out of control, and I\u2019m not sure if wages can keep up, especially with rising inflation. However, this also incentivizes home owners to renovate since this is a seller\u2019s market. Subsequently, I expect HD stock to rise steadily on the prospect of increasing revenues. During what potentially could be an extended drought, I wouldn\u2019t mind \u201cbuying down\u201d (NASDAQ: ). If you have a longer-term perspective, I don\u2019t think price targets and timing the bottom is helpful. For starters, you never really know with any consistency where that bottom is. More importantly, though, NVDA stock is too good of an opportunity with which to play games. In my view, that makes NVDA easily one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy during this correction. In particular, I\u2019m bullish on Nvidia because it has so many revenue channels. Obviously, as a prime graphics processor company, NVDA banks heavily on the . Additionally, its processors are highly desired in the cryptocurrency mining sphere, especially . Gaming and cryptocurrencies are significant tailwinds for NVDA stock, but as I\u2019ve argued, they\u2019re not the only bullish factors. The company has been a mainstay in the driverless technology realm. Furthermore, it\u2019s making significant inroads into deep learning and . The bottom line is that NVDA stock is the investment levered towards future industries that have yet to be born. Feel free to acquire positions on any sizable dip. During any severe corrections in the Dow Jones index, you want to concentrate on established, secular names. Like Home Depot, (NYSE: ) is one of the best stocks to buy in this current malaise. No matter how badly the underlying economy may fall, we all need to clean our teeth and wash our hair. Technically speaking, the Dow Jones crash gifted new investors with an opportunity to go long JNJ stock. Where prices stand now, shares are back to where they were for most of last year\u2019s summer season. But current trading sentiment looks very pensive. On Tuesday, JNJ only clawed back 1% of Monday\u2019s severe drop, and has since dropped further. This weakness suggests that further declines are likely. The next logical support line stands at just above $120. If JNJ stock does indeed fall that low, you should buy without hesitation. Not only is Johnson & Johnson an iconic brand with incredible international reach, the company pays a 2.6% dividend yield. Granted, it\u2019s not the biggest payout that you can find in the markets. But with a combination of stability and passive income, not considering JNJ stock would be almost criminal. I don\u2019t understand the immediate gut reaction when people see red ink splashed on the Dow Jones index. I\u2019m a cryptocurrency investor, after all! But don\u2019t let the immediate pain detract you from your forward-looking strategy. A major crash almost always produces great opportunities, and . (NYSE: ) is one of them. Needless to say, UPS stock took a big hit during this broader market collapse. Year-to-date, shares are down 12%. Moreover, things were looking dicey before the Dow Jones decided to become a Paris Hilton-style hot mess. As feature writer James Brumley reported, despite topping its fourth quarter sales and earnings estimates, UPS shares cratered. Why? Brumley explains that \u201cthe company was during the quarter when holiday-driven shipping was its most frenzied.\u201d To avoid a recurrence, UPS will ramp-up its infrastructure spending. Wall Street didn\u2019t like that, so down goes UPS stock. Let the current shareholders\u2019 loss be your gain. UPS isn\u2019t going anywhere, demonstrating growth in both domestic and especially international markets. Maybe it wasn\u2019t worth $135 a pop, but towards $100? This is a risk worth taking! For the same reasons that I like UPS, you should also consider its key rival (NYSE: ). Admittedly, a good chunk of my reasoning is that FDX stock is a hedge within the courier service industry. Should UPS not deliver the goods, so to speak, I firmly expect FDX to come through, and vice-versa. But thanks to the Dow Jones crash, FDX stock is too good of an opportunity to pass up. So far this year, FedEx shares are down nearly 9%. Just like its rival, FDX traders acted pensively following Monday\u2019s wild ride. I believe this insecure, apprehensive trading signals further declines, perhaps down to $220. If that occurs, FDX moves from \u201cstocks to buy\u201d to \u201cstocks you should already own.\u201d Aside from the fact that FedEx is too big to fail, the changing retail landscape boosts the entire courier ecosystem. We\u2019re not just talking about . (NASDAQ: ). More retail businesses are shifting away from the traditional brick-and-mortar model to the model. Customers nowadays simply expect their purchased products to arrive at their doorstep. This unstoppable trend means that FDX stock is an ideal play right now. After just criticizing the brick-and-mortar retail space, it may seem strange to include (NYSE: ) on this list. Nothing screams traditional retail culture and crass American consumerism quite like Walmart. But from an investor\u2019s point of view, WMT stock is a behemoth. The company makes its own rules, and really, who are we to disagree? Like I just mentioned, the retail landscape has changed dramatically. Business don\u2019t want to open shop fronts; instead, they need warehousing space to deliver their goods directly to their customers. But certain items just can\u2019t be shipped for economical and logistical reasons. Whether you need food, or clothing, or diapers for your baby, WMT has all your disparate needs covered; and more importantly, they can feed that need immediately. Best of all, WMT stock absorbed a good-sized beating. Against this year\u2019s closing high, WMT is down nearly 8%. As with other names I mentioned on this stocks to buy list, WMT traders lack confidence and conviction. If the broader markets don\u2019t receive a massive influx of great news, I anticipate shares will fall to $80. Should that occur, run, don\u2019t walk, towards WMT stock! Secular companies are always solid picks when the markets collapse. However, if you anticipate a much more protracted decline, you should eye vice stocks. Within this colorful category stands (NYSE: ), one of the world\u2019s biggest tobacco companies. It stinks to say this, but Altria has more or less an addicted consumer base; thus, no matter what happens in the underlying economy, MO stock has a dependable revenue stream. Furthermore, MO pays out a handsome, 4.1% dividend yield. Critics contend that the rise of e-cigarettes, or vaporizers, will eat away at Altria\u2019s market share. This is true, but largely to the extent that health concerns drive the transition from \u201canalog\u201d to electronic cigarettes. However, when smokers attempt \u201cvaping,\u201d they discover that the nicotine-based \u201cthroat hit\u201d sensation is significant different in the vaporizer format. Thus, to regular cigarettes, and inevitably, into the arms of MO and company. In addition, cigarette companies have their own digital alternatives. What better way to replicate throat hit than the \u201cfounders\u201d of this sensation? Finally, MO stock got beat up pretty badly in the Dow Jones crash. That gives you the opportunity to buy a solid, high-yielding company at a discounted rate!

{"text": "(NASDAQ: ) reported Thursday,\u00a0but was it good enough to turn Wall Street's skeptics to bulls? Here's a look at how some Wall Street analysts reacted. Oppenheimer's Rick Schafer maintains a Perform rating on with no assigned price target. Nvidia came into its Q4 earnings report with a \"high bar,\" and the company cleared it, Schafer said in a note. Sales of $2.91 billion and an EPS figure of $1.69 both came in \"easily ahead\" of the Street's projection of $2.68 billion and $1.16 per share, the analyst said. Revenue from the data center, gaming, pro-visualization and OEM segments each came in at least 5 percent ahead of the consensus. It was the seventh consecutive quarter where Nvidia more than doubled data center revenue, reaffirming the \"significant market size and opportunity\" the company has in artificial intelligence given its virtual monopoly in data center accelerators., Schafer said. The company's V100 product boasts clients from some of the largest international companies, and continued adoption will drive average selling price and margin growth, he said. Despite Nvidia's impressive 41-percent revenue growth rate in the quarter, the stock is trading at a multiple north of 30x the analyst's 2019 estimates, which implies a \"balanced\" risk-reward profile, the analyst said. FBR's Craig Ellis maintains a Buy rating on Nvidia's stock with a price target raised from $270 to $290. Nvidia's Q4 report solidifies the thesis that the company's positives continue to outweigh the negatives, and the company can still report upside even when the Street moves estimates higher, Ellis said in a note. The gaming channel inventory was \"unusually lean\" in a seasonally soft period, and even diligent supply efforts won't be enough to catch demand before a product refresh in March, the analyst said. In fact, a fifth consecutive year of 35-percent gaming growth is possible, he said. The data center segment doubled for the eighth consecutive quarter, and while auto \u2014 down 8 percent quarter-over-quarter \u2014 \"undershot\" versus expectations, the company's robust long-term growth profile is full of significant partnerships, Ellis said. The analyst's prior $270 price target was based on a 13.5x fiscal 2020 P/sales multiple, but recent market volatility calls for a reduction in the multiple to 12.5x, Ellis said. At the same time, the company's earnings report prompted a revision in sales estimates in fiscal 2020 from $12.392 billion to $14.449 billion, which boosts B Riley FBR's price target to $290. Tigress Financial's Ivan Feinseth said in his daily newsletter that he continues to recommend buying the stock and sees a near-term target of $250 per share. Citi's Atif Malik saidNvidia continues to be a beneficiary of multiple secular growth themes, including eSports, artificial intelligence and autonomous driving. KeyBanc Capital Markets' Michael McConnell for Nvidia's stock is 25x on 2020 EPS of $8.25, or $206 per share. Venture capitalist Gene Munster is \"further evidence of the magnitude of the opportunity ahead.

{"text": "Menu Source: Shutterstock Admittedly, it took a while, but I came around to the bull case for (NASDAQ: ) last year. The issue over the past few years hasn\u2019t been Nvidia\u2019s performance or its market opportunities. Rather, the concern has been the price of Nvidia stock. After all, as I pointed out in December, semiconductor stocks at the multiples assigned to NVDA stock. Historically, the chip sector traded at a discount to the overall market. Semiconductors tend to be cyclical, and pricing steadily declines over time. Consistent earnings growth can be difficult to drive. But the reason Nvidia stock is priced like an outlier in the sector is that the company itself is an outlier. And fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday afternoon further proved that point. Nvidia posted , smashing consensus estimates. And yet the gains in NVDA stock have moderated considerably: NVDA stock has waffled between barely eeking out a gain and the 6% it\u2019s currently trading at, after rising as much as 14% in after-hours trading. The stock still sits almost 10% below an all-time high reached in January, before market-wide jitters led to a pullback. There should be little doubt that NVDA will return to \u2014 and surpass \u2014 those highs, and I\u2019d expect that to happen relatively quickly. Both Q4 earnings and Q1 guidance were hugely impressive. Valuation still is high, but it\u2019s not as high as it\u2019s been in past quarters. And after Q4, investors still should be willing to pay a premium for Nvidia stock, considering the growth opportunities that still lay ahead for the company. Nvidia has been making a mockery of Street estimates for over two years now. But even past beats pale in comparison to the numbers the company put up on Thursday. Revenue of $2.91 billion rose 34% year-over-year \u2014 a full ten points better than consensus. Adjusted EPS of $1.72 rose 52%; analysts had been looking for an increase under 20%. As far as Q1 guidance goes, it\u2019s much the same. Nvidia expects revenue of $2.9 billion, plus or minus 2%; the Street was looking for just $2.48 billion. Essentially, analysts thought heading into the quarter that growth would decelerate. And that wasn\u2019t an illogical prediction. Comparisons are getting tougher and gaming demand should be moderating. Meanwhile, that benefited Nvidia and (NASDAQ: ) petered out toward the end of the quarter. Yet Nvidia continues to post almost unprecedented growth with strength across the board. Gross margin rose 330 basis points. GPU sales rose 33%; revenue from the smaller Tegra business increased 75% YoY. The gaming category rose 29%, professional visualization 13%, and the OEM and IP business grew 2% despite the end of licensing revenue from (NASDAQ: ) in the first quarter. Most notably, Datacenter sales more than doubled, as Nvidia continues to take share from Intel in that key market. Datacenter now drives over 20% of revenue, adding a second growth driver for Nvidia going forward. And with Q1 guidance strong, Nvidia looks set up for a strong fiscal 2019. And yet NVDA stock has given back most of its post-earnings gains, despite selling off heading into the quarter. It\u2019s tough to see what has tempered investors\u2019 enthusiasm for the quarter. The Automotive category could be seen as a disappointment, as revenue grew just 3% year-over-year and actually declined 8% from Q3. One analyst on the Q4 call referenced the recent production ramp at customer (NASDAQ: ) in asking when that category would inflect. But that remains a late calendar year 2019 event at the earliest, as CEO Jen-Hsun Huang replied. Sales now are largely relegated to infotainment where cost pressures are mounting, and where Nvidia at Tesla to Intel. One quarter\u2019s results in that space simply don\u2019t affect the long-term case for Nvidia\u2019s role in autonomous driving. And elsewhere, the long-term case for NVDA seems nothing but strengthened. Guidance for the first quarter appears to suggest earnings will nearly double year-over-year. Backing out the company\u2019s $8 per share in cash, and assuming non-GAAP EPS of $6-plus next year (an easy target: $7 is in play based on Q1 guidance), NVDA suddenly is trading closer to 30-35x EPS, and an even lower multiple to free cash flow. That\u2019s an attractive multiple for the type of growth Nvidia is posting. Even analysts have come along with . Yet, the market seems to be dragging its feet. Whether that\u2019s just the sign of a nervous market\u00a0or investors are seeing something in the results that I\u2019m not, that seems like a mistake. Q4 was a blowout quarter. Growth isn\u2019t ending any time soon. Valuation isn\u2019t prohibitive. This isn\u2019t (NASDAQ: ), obviously, from a valuation standpoint, but a 30x-plus multiple is easily sustainable if Nvidia keeps performing. Nothing in the quarter suggests it won\u2019t. And so, when confidence returns, NVDA stock should be moving back toward $250 and beyond.

{"text": "Technology market whiz Gene Munster \u2013 from his research-driven, venture capital firm Loup Ventures \u2013 is out with an upbeat slice of perspective following an \u2018intoxicatingly\u2019 good quarterly print from NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ: ). Clearly, investors agree, as shares are flying 7% in trading today. After all, with Nvidia posting $2.9 billion against the Street\u2019s $2.7 billion, and EPS of $1.72 soaring past the Street\u2019s $1.16, that acts as a major needle mover in the market. This marks 34% year-over-year growth for the semiconductor player, and Munster is taking notice. The fourth quarter results for 2017 showcase an enticing one-two punch of more rapid-fire as well as increasingly profitable growth, from where Munster is standing. In other words, the \u201cresults are further evidence of the magnitude of the opportunity ahead of Nvidia,\u201d cheers the research analyst, who believes: \u201cIts products are a foundational part of the future of technology, based on their use in data centers, autonomous vehicles, virtual and augmented reality platforms, cryptocurrency mining, and eSports. We remain believers in the long-term Nvidia story. While shares of NVDA are up 100% over the past year (market cap of $129 billion), we think there\u2019s further upside given Nvidia\u2019s foundational exposure to frontier technologies. Earnings and model recap.\u201d The company boasts a \u201cpole position in three green field growth markets,\u201d between gaming, datacenter, and automotive- which all present \u201copen-ended growth opportunities,\u201d writes Munster. Gaming shot up 29% year-over-year for the quarter, with Nvidia earning $1.74 billion in revenue, riding a wave of \u201chigh-quality, hit games in the market.\u201d Worthy of note, the research analyst calls attention to Activision\u2019s new Overwatch league that had a launch just last month, reporting 10 million unique users in the opening week. Munster explains, \u201cThe success of these games is leading to both an increase in the number of GPUs sold, as well as ASPs for Nvidia.\u201d With cryptocurrency mining benefiting GPU demand and likewise lifting the company\u2019s gaming segment performance, the analyst predicts that down the line, \u201cthe outlook for gaming remains promising.\u201d Meanwhile, datacenter revenues vaulted 105% year-over-year to a whopping $606 million. This is the seventh quarter in a row that the company\u2019s datacenter segment has yielded growth spanning three-digits. Munster points to artificial intelligence investments as a key driver here- and \u201cwe\u2019re in the early innings artificial intelligence.\u201d Automotive was the weakest of the segments, earning a 3% year-over-year jump to $132 million. However, Munster says with confidence, not to worry: \u201cDespite little growth, remains Nvidia\u2019s biggest opportunity.\u201d Looking ahead, the leading short-term prospects point to the DGX system; the autonomous-geared DRIVE PX platform; and goals to establish development deals with leading OEMs, ride-hailing firms, startups, and tech firms to bolster efforts in the autonomy market. Looking ahead, by word of Munster\u2019s crystal ball, this is a vastly underestimated market that could leap to 13% in accounting for revenue by 2023. By 2040, the analyst predicts 90% of vehicles driving will need a platform just like Nvidia\u2019s DRIVE PX. showcases cautiously optimistic sentiment on the Street surveying the chip giant. Out of 23 analysts polled in the last 3 months, 11 are bullish on Nvidia stock, 11 remain sidelined, while 1 is bearish on the stock. With a return potential of 7%, the stock\u2019s consensus target price stands at $247.33.", "link": "https://www.smarteranalyst.com/2018/02/09/tech-expert-gene-munster-sees-standout-nvidia-corporation-q4-show-proof-big-opportunity-ahead/", "source": "MarketWatch", "author": null, "tick": "NVDA", "headline": "Tech Expert Gene Munster Sees Standout NVIDIA Corporation Q4 Show as More Proof of Big Opportunity Ahead - Smarter Analyst"}

{"text": "Published: ALBANY, New York, February 7, 2018 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ --\nALBANY, New York, February 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- A recent business intelligence publication by Transparency Market Research (TMR) notifies that while startups are mushrooming in the , the competitive landscape remains moderately consolidated among a few players. The analysts of the report have identified NVIDIA Corporation and INTEL Corporation as the top two companies who were ahead of the curve in 2016, whereas Google Inc., Qualcomm Incorporated, IBM Corporation, CEVA Inc., Xilinx, Graphcore, Teradeep Inc., and Advanced Micro Devices are some of the other notable companies currently harnessing the prospects of deep learning.   Since the entry barriers of this market are not incredibly high and heavily dependent on technologies that are not patented, startups have a strong chance to make a mark. In the near future, the shares in the global deep learning chipset are expected to head towards a fragmented scenario, although most of the prominent chip manufacturers are anticipated to hold onto their position of strength. Market leaders are expected to frequently indulge into acquisition and collaboration activities with startups with niche concepts. For instance, in January 2016, Google Inc. agreed to collaborate with Movidius to enhance its deep learning portfolio on mobile devices, which was later acquired by Intel Corporation. Later in August the same year, Intel Corporation also acquired Nervana Systems in order to further solidify its position in developing the hardware chipsets platform.     If the projections of the TMR report are to be believed, the demand in the global deep learning chipset market will increment at a phenomenal CAGR of 24.7% during the forecast period of 2017 to 2025. The report has estimated that from its calculated worth of merely US$150.17 mn in 2015, the opportunities in the global deep learning market will translate into a revenue of US$1,264.78 mn by the end of 2025. Based on type, the TMR report segments the global deep learning chipset market into application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and others. Compute capacity bifurcation of the market has been done into low (less than 1 TFlops) and high (greater than 1 TFlops). End-user classification of the market has been done into automotive, consumer electronics, healthcare, industrial, aerospace and defense, and others. Geographically, the analysts have detected that although North America currently provides for the maximum chunk of demand, the region of Asia Pacific will overtake in terms of demand and revenue by the end of 2025.      The global deep learning chipset market is primarily driven by significant improvements in the chip algorithms in the last few year, which has enormously increased their ability to consume and manage data efficiently. With increasing adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) that promises to connect billions of new devices and pertaining data streams, it is very likely that much more digital data will be generated and consequently, the industry of machine learning and deep learning will flourish. Moreover, newly build algorithms are shifting the learning from one particular application to another application, making it easily possible for the machines to learn from very fewer examples. Invention of a related computer chip, which is known as GPU or graphic processing unit, is turning out to be very meaningful and effective when it is being applied to types of calculations required for neural nets. Speed up of 10x times are also very much viable when the neural nets will move from traditional CPU to GPU.

{"text": "Published: Opinion: Gaming and server businesses are living up to the hype, but self-driving-car sales are still in the future By Nvidia Corp. reported full-year earnings Thursday that validated the huge increase in its stock price over the past two-plus years, but the final piece of the bull theory is still in neutral until at least later this year. Nvidia\u2019s numbers were eye-popping, especially for a company that has been public for nearly 20 years and experienced an annual sales decline just five years ago. The key numbers for Nvidia\u2019s 2018 fiscal year: , profit increased 83% (yes, that\u2019s GAAP) and gross margin increased by 110 basis points. Those numbers were just part of , which sent shares up more than 7% in late trading. Nvidia stock has already gained 83.4% in the past year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 23.9%, and that rise came on top of the biggest gains on the S&P 500 index in 2016. Nvidia\u2019s ride has been fueled by greater demand for its core product, graphics chips, which have found a home beyond videogames thanks to their usefulness in machine learning. The general bull theory is that Nvidia\u2019s core gaming business will continue to grow thanks to the rise of esports and more graphically-intense videogames, while new businesses selling chips for servers and autonomous cars will eventually be huge. With its fourth-quarter report, Nvidia lived up to two parts of that theory. The core gaming business, which has been boosted by demands for those same chips , grew nearly 36% to more than $5.5 billion in revenue, more than Nvidia\u2019s revenue total in any year before the previous one. The server business, meanwhile, came close to $2 billion in annual revenue, after failing to touch $1 billion the year before and mostly failing to exist before that. The one laggard so far is the automotive business, which declined sequentially in the fourth quarter and grew less than 15% for the full year. The results were below analysts\u2019 average expectations for the second quarter in a row. Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call Thursday that Nvidia automotive sales fell as its ditches a longtime business of providing chips that power in-car systems to next-generation auto supplies. \u201cThe sequential decline reflects our transition from infotainment, which is becoming commoditized, to next-generation AI cockpit systems and complete top-to-bottom self-driving-vehicle platforms built on Nvidia hardware and software,\u201d Kress said. Nvidia , including a focus on and new in-car experiences involving augmented reality. Based on Thursday\u2019s commentary, we may see Nvidia\u2019s auto business struggle a bit before they realize any gains from their plans for the future. The Xavier processor, a chip with 9 billion transistors that Nvidia calls the most complex system-on-a-chip ever created, is expected to eventually drive its automotive business. It will act as the heart of its Nvidia Drive ecosystem, a platform it has developed for car makers to use to create safe self-driving cars. Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told analysts that he believes the really big revenue from automotive will begin in about 2019 to 2020, when auto makers, startups, taxi companies, ride-hailing companies and others begin to order self-driving capabilities in their vehicles and fleets. He revealed that the brains for self-driving cars will sell for an average of about $500 to $1,000, while those for \u201crobo-taxis,\u201d as Nvidia refers to autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, will command several thousand dollars each. The upside for Nvidia\u2019s automotive business is expected to come from software, bigger volumes of its chips and for self-driving cars. Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein Research analyst, wrote in a recent note that he expects growth in automotive \u201cto come from software development agreements related to autonomous driving at some point this year,\u201d he said. Investors who have bought into Nvidia are reaping rewards from gaming, cryptocurrency and a booming server business right now, but the automotive business still needs some gas. If that business is as big as Nvidia has claimed, shares could keep driving higher. Join the conversation Copyright \u00a9 2018 MarketWatch, Inc.  All rights reserved.

{"text": "Published: Tech \u2018may never look the same again,\u2019 S&P warns By The overhaul of the U.S. tax law may be good for tech companies, many of which have kept billions of dollars overseas because of tax rates, but in the long run, it may weaken the credit profile of the sector. In a Thursday report, S&P Global Ratings warned investors that \u201cthe technology sector may never look the same again,\u201d now that the U.S. tax overhaul will allow for tech giants to bring back billions of dollars from overseas coffers. While viewed as an overall positive, it could also result in more fast and loose financial policies that could damage creditworthiness in the sector. Earlier in the week, on signs of weakening earnings. S&P said it believes \u201cthe overall industry credit profile will weaken over time, largely because of the potential for more aggressive financial policies in response to greater access to overseas cash.\u201d Resulting lower cash balances will result in weaker credit metrics ultimately, S&P said, and those aggressive financial policies appear to be key. S&P noted: \u201cIf an issuer adopts a more aggressive financial policy than we expect after repatriation, likely through additional share repurchases, its credit metrics could deteriorate based upon our policy of netting surplus cash against debt, potentially leading to rating or outlook revisions. Generally, we will not deduct surplus cash from debt if a company is (1) owned by a financial sponsor as defined in our criteria, or (2) has a business risk profile at the lower end of the scale (i.e., weak or vulnerable as described in our criteria).\u201d S&P points to \u2019s recent announcement that it plans to go from having and said the tech giant could be a trend setter for the industry.    \u201cWe anticipate that other large cash holders will also announce enhanced shareholder returns over time,\u201d S&P said. Topping that list along with Apple is the only AAA-rated tech issue  along with     and   Then, there are those companies who have as much about as much debt as they have cash to repatriate. Should those companies use the repatriated cash to return to shareholders and still hold on to the debt, that could be harmful to their rating.    S&P noted: Unlike issuers with large net cash positions, we believe those that have both high cash and debt balances face potential credit risks because they may choose to use substantial portions of now-accessible foreign cash for shareholder returns. These issuers, some of which have modest net cash positions or are in net debt positions, will have to manage a delicate balance between equity holders and debtholders. Depletion of cash, if not offset by some debt reduction, can raise leverage by our calculation and lead us to consider a downgrade. S&P used Oracle as an example, pointing out that while it has $72 billion in cash, about 35% of its market cap, it also has $61 billion in debt so its net cash is relatively low, at about 5% of market cap. Other companies in this boat include    and  S&P said. \u201cWe believe companies with these types of balance sheets will have to clarify their financial policies to both equity and bond investors over the coming quarters as cash comes back on shore,\u201d according to S&P. Tech companies that have seen their stocks underperform over the past year or so are particularly vulnerable, because there\u2019s more incentive to return money to shareholders to boost stock prices. S&P said: We are very attentive to the repatriation-related earnings call comments from issuers whose share prices have underperformed the overall market during the past year. Issuers with meaningful cash balances offshore are likely engaged in deep board-level discussions to finalize their capital allocation strategies and we have already heard from some management commenting about \u201creturn of excess capital\u201d to shareholders. We believe that management of companies whose share prices have lagged the market will feel greater pressure to appease the shareholders through aggressive share repurchases or risky acquisitions. One example S&P used was  Over the past 12 months, shares of Juniper have declined 8%, compared with the 15% gain in the S&P 500 index and the 22% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index  On the other hand, companies like  and  which are up 90% and 70%, respectively, over the past 12 months, will have a lot more flexibility with the timing a size of shareholder returns and will likely be better able to balance stock and bondholder needs, S&P said.

{"text": "Published: Bond funds offer no safety from the stock market\u2019s decline By Many average investors are committing a blunder now. It\u2019s not all their fault, though, as information is often dumbed down in the interest of simplicity. As Einstein said: \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler.\u201d Unfortunately, often the information provided to average investors has been simplified below the bare minimum. To avoid the blunder, average investors need a bit of sophistication. To fully understand how to avoid the blunder, let us first start with a chart that illustrates the point. Read on for the blunder and how to avoid it.   Please click for the chart of iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF Please observe the following important points on the chart: \u2022 The chart shows that TLT has fallen about 18% from its recent peak. \u2022 An average investor who bought near the peak to collect about 2.75% interest has now lost about 18% of the principal. \u2022 If interest rates normalize even to the recent low levels, an average investor who bought near the peak will lose 42% of the principal.         Many average investors believe the myth that bonds are safe. There is some truth to the understanding that bonds are safer than stocks, but average investors miss an important nuance. If you buy an individual Treasury bond or a bond of a company with a solid balance sheet and hold it to maturity, you will get your principal back. However, this is not the case when you buy mutual funds or ETFs.   Many average investors are advised to start with 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds. Of course, adjustments are made based on age and objectives. Investors are told that stocks are for growth and bonds are for safety and income. Many average investors do not understand that they can lose a lot of money in bonds.   Bonds have been in a 30-year bull market. For this reason, the bad advice given to investors has not hurt them so far. However, average investors need to know that the bull market has ended.   As stock market volatility has risen, many average investors who want safety are moving out of stocks into bonds. They are doing so because they do not understand the following: \u2022 They can lose money in bonds, as illustrated in the chart linked above. \u2022 Interest rates are rising. \u2022 Bonds move inverse to interest rates. In plain English, when interest rates go higher, bonds go lower. \u2022 Stocks are experiencing volatility because of rising interest rates.   First and foremost, do not buy bond funds or ETFs. Second, understand that most funds and popular ETFs are concentrated in a handful of stocks that have run up and now pose a high risk. For example, the top holdings of popular ETF are Apple Microsoft and Facebook Alphabet  is right there too. These are also the top holdings of popular ETF along with Nvidia Netflix and Qualcomm  The point is that many investors are overly concentrated in technology stocks.

{"text": "Published: Server-chip sales grew 105%, one analyst sees \u2018another strong leg up\u2019 in the near future By Rapid growth in Nvidia Corp.\u2019s data-center business helped power another strong quarter of results that pushed shares higher Friday, and supporters don\u2019t see that momentum letting up. Though not Nvidia\u2019s largest business, the server segment is its fastest-growing. Revenue , to $606 million, ahead of the FactSet consensus estimate for 85% growth. That\u2019s one big reason why Nvidia shares gained in Friday morning trading. \u201cWe believe this dynamic demonstrates consistent demand for Nvidia\u2019s leading-edge data center products, driving [average selling price] and margin strength,\u201d wrote Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer. He noted that the company\u2019s V100 product already has a number of high-profile adopters, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , Amazon.com Inc. Alphabet Inc.  , Baidu Inc. International Business Machines Corp. Microsoft Corp. Oracle Corp. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. Schafer has a perform rating on Nvidia shares.   Raymond James analyst Chris Caso is also optimistic about Nvidia\u2019s data-center business, pointing out that sales of Volta GPUs are still ramping up. \u201cWith only two cloud customers on Volta, the rest are still deploying Pascal-related boards, suggesting another strong leg up is yet to come in that market,\u201d he wrote. Caso added that the data-center business is likely the major factor behind Nvidia\u2019s big rally over the past year, with shares up 95% in that time versus a 12% gain for the S&P 500 and a 27% rise for the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index  \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019re anywhere near the end of the Volta product cycle,\u201d he wrote, while maintaining an outperform rating. \u201cThe stock\u2019s valuation is of course high, but as long as the company keeps putting up quarters like this, and with future potential catalysts from auto and inferencing ahead, we believe shares will continue to move higher.\u201d Nvidia\u2019s automotive business , but analysts seemed nonetheless optimistic about that segment going forward. \u201cConcern over [whether] Nvidia can maintain the momentum fails to recognize an additional autonomous vehicle tailwind ramping significantly in FY20,\u201d wrote Needham\u2019s Rajvindra Gill, who has a buy rating on the stock. He raised his target price to $300 from $250. Cryptocurrency-related revenue delivered a nice boost to Nvidia\u2019s results during the latest quarter, given that its . With Ethereum prices down sharply, however, there\u2019s some debate over the potential impact of this business on Nvidia\u2019s results in the future. In a note titled \u201cLove the Data Center... Hate the Crypto,\u201d Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland dubbed sales of GPUs for Ethereum mining a \u201clong-term negative\u201d for Nvidia. He noted that the company issued a strong forecast for its fiscal first quarter, which ends in April, and worries that \u201cpotentially fleeting crypto GPU sales may set 2Q18 guidance up poorly.\u201d Some analysts from Proof of Work protocol to Proof of Stake protocol in the first half of the year, which could hurt Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Proof of Work requires GPU mining, while Proof of Stake doesn\u2019t. Rolland believes that Ethereum-related sales of GPUs may have exceeded $400 million in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. He has a neutral rating on shares, and he raised his price target to $215 from $200 following the results. Needham\u2019s Gill, who estimates about $140 million in crypto revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter, also warned that \u201chigh crypto mining demand and potential volatility could spill off and cause fluctuations in the Gaming business.\u201d Raymond James\u2019 Caso isn\u2019t concerned when he looks at the overall business. \u201cWhile investors are likely to question the sustainability of recent crypto-driven strength\u2014and its impact on tight supply\u2014management is taking a relatively conservative approach, assuming flat crypto demand in April and highlighting pent-up \u201ctraditional\u201d gaming-driven demand,\u201d he wrote. At least 20 analysts increased price targets on Nvidia stock Friday morning, according to FactSet, though none changed their ratings. Emily Bary is a MarketWatch reporter based in New York.
