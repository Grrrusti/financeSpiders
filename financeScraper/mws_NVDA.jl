Investors are more concerned with the future than the past and, as such, are looking to 2018 to see what Baidu has in store. With forays into , (AI), and self-driving cars, the company is setting the stage for future success. The company made some intriguing announcements at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) early this year, showing that there is more to come. Based on its recent performance and current developments, 2018 could be Baidu's best year yet. Baidu released a host of AI-enabled products at the CES. Image source: Baidu. Recent revelations show that Baidu's history of innovation is continuing. The company announced it would be adding three smart hardware products powered by its conversational computing platform DuerOS. The Little Fish VSI Smart Speaker features a built-in screen, providing users with a wide range of functionality. The device integrates with iQiyi, the company's streaming service, providing users a large video library. It can also support multi-party video calls, as well as voice access to Baidu's leading search. Little Fish also delivers facial recognition and parental controls. Baidu also unveiled the Sengled smart lamp and speaker, also featuring the DuerOS. The product is the first voice-enabled smart lamp in China, and supports a variety of lighting modes. It can be used as a night light, reading lamp, and provides 16 million color configurations that can react to the rhythm of a song -- all accomplished via voice commands. The company also introduced the Aladdin smart dome light, which will jointly debut for customers in Japan. The device serves as a light, a projector, and smart speaker, and its smaller form factor is optimized for smaller home sizes in Japan. These come on the heels of Baidu's launch of the Raven series of AI-powered smart home products at Baidu World in November, which the company describes as \"a blend of technology and art.\" The Raven H smart speaker hosts a detachable base for portability, while the Raven R is \"the world's first automated six-axis robot with emotional intelligence.\" Baidu's Apollo has an impressive list of partners. Image source: Baidu. In a surprise move last year, Baidu announced that it would , which it named Apollo, after the U.S. lunar landing program of the same name. Baidu has said that it aims for Apollo to be the \"Android of the auto industry.\" At CES, Baidu introduced Apollo 2.0, the \"most robust version yet\" of the company's autonomous driving platform. Baidu has enlisted more than 90 partners in the venture and revealed that  would provide its Azure platform for markets outside China, including a recently announced expansion into Singapore. Apollo will integrate with self-driving computing platforms from   . This continues a long collaboration between NVIDIA and Baidu, which last year announced a which resulted in NVIDIA's DRIVE PS 2 AI supercomputer forming the foundation of Baidu's self-driving platform. The Apollo platform has been adopted for passenger vehicles, buses, and ride-sharing companies and Baidu plans to launch a pilot in Los Angeles in 2018 to provide short distance autonomous rides to those with disabilities. Baidu is widely regarded as having the most advanced AI program in China and among the best in the world. The company reorganized itself around a foundation of mobile and AI, and those efforts are beginning to bear fruit. The company was to lead the development of the country's national laboratory for . Baidu believes that with strong government support and the largest population of consumers worldwide, the company is well-positioned to close the gap with the U.S. in developing AI technology. In its , Baidu's revenue grew to $3.53 billion, up 29% year over year, while its earnings per share of $3.62 grew 182% over the prior year quarter -- both of which blew past analyst's consensus estimates of $3.47 billion and $2.19 per share, respectively. This shows that the company has returned solidly to growth, putting its prior challenges in the rearview mirror. The combination of new products, a growing list of big-name partners, and a significant head start in the development of AI, I think 2018 will be Baidu's best year yet. Daniel W.

Spending on virtual currency, downloadable content, and micro-transactions have helped the company exceed expectations in advance of major game releases to come in early 2018. Activision Blizzard stock gained 75% in 2017, making it one of the best performers of the year. For many years, NVIDIA's graphics processing units (GPUs) have been the most sought after among serious gamers, and that didn't change in 2017. In the third quarter, the company commanded 72.8% of the discrete desktop GPU market.\u00a0Gaming produced more than 59% of the company's revenue in its 2018 fiscal third quarter (which ended Oct. 29, 2017). NVIDIA also continued to be the leading provider of GPUs for the artificial intelligence (AI) market, which has become an increasingly important part of the company's growth. Data center revenue for AI has produced triple-digit year-over-year growth in each of the last six quarters and now generates 19% of NVIDIA's total sales. Gaming and AI made it a banner year for NVIDIA. Image source: NVIDIA. NVIDIA shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, it announced that its latest Volta GPU became the processor of choice of \"every major internet and cloud service provider and computer maker.\" , and its stock jumped 81%. PayPal investors couldn't have asked for a better year from the payment processor. In a move designed to give its users more choice, the company partnered with many of the largest credit card issuers and payment processors, putting together a veritable who's who of financial giants. These moves resulted in record-breaking additions to PayPal's customer accounts, increasing its base to 227 million. Each customer is also spending more, with the number of payment transactions per active account growing to 33.6 over the trailing 12 months. PayPal partnered with ... well, everybody!

Venmo produced $35 billion in total payment volume over the preceding 12 months, up 97% over the prior period. The app can now be used to pay merchants as well, providing PayPal with a new source of revenue. Each of these factors played into , and its stock gained 86% as a result. Micron was another big benefactor of the developments in AI in 2017, providing the memory chips required. The company is one of the largest producers of DRAM and NAND flash memory chips. Significant shortages of memory and higher prices drove the company from losses the year before to substantial profits.

{"tick": "NVDA", "author": "Philip van Doorn", "text": "Published: The iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF has outperformed the stock market and includes many companies increasing sales very quickly By Finding fast-growing stocks can be done without sacrificing your ethical standards, as one of the largest socially responsible ETFs shows. To provide a basis for listing rapidly growing companies that meet quality ESG (environmental, social and corporate governance) criteria, we looked at the iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF which\u00a0tracks the MSCI USA ESG Select Index. MSCI maintains the index by screening for the predictable \u2014 protecting the environment, other social concerns and problems with corporate governance \u2014 but it digs much further into other areas that can put companies and their share prices at risk. These include accounting policies, qualifications of board members and dozens of other factors. The iShares fund invests in about 100 companies that have the highest MSCI ESG ratings. It aims to deliver a similar return to that of the overall market while maintaining a high ESG standard. Over the past 12 months, it has outperformed the S&P 500 on a total return basis, with dividends reinvested. One reason for that outperformance is that the ETF hasn\u2019t been invested in industrial conglomerates, according to Sarah Kjellberg, the head of BlackRock\u2019s iShares Sustainable ETFs group. The S&P 500 Industrial Conglomerates industry group has fallen 5.3% over the past 12 months, according to FactSet. There are only eight companies in this group, with General Electric Co.\u2019s 41% decline weighing heavily. During an interview on Jan. 23, Kjellberg said a heavier weighting in certain real-estate investment trusts also has helped the ETF outperform the S&P 500 over the past year. The iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF ranks within the \u201ctop percentile\u201d of all funds in Lipper\u2019s ESG category, with an ESG rating of 8.3 out of 10, she said. This ETF weights its investments according to the ratings, but limits each position to 5% of assets in order to provide what FactSet calls \u201ca reasonably good fit to the overall equity market.\u201d Time and time again investors have seen how difficult it is for most active stock-fund managers to outperform broad indexes consistently. Index funds that track the S&P 500 are among the largest funds in the world. And many ESG index funds have been competitive with the S&P 500. Howard Gold recently listed that have relatively low expenses and investment minimums.    The ETF has underperformed the broad index over longer periods, but not by very much.This is what it looks like over five years: and over 10 years: So an investor who has been dedicated to the ESG path over the past 10 years has not made a major sacrifice when compared with the performance of the broad market. \u201cWhat is most germaine to the public today is data security, especially when you look at financial services companies,\u201d Kjellberg said. MSCI ESG Ratings downgraded Equifax Inc. to its lowest rating of CCC in 2016. This is well before the major Equifax data breach, which took place between May and July 2017 and . The iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF had already ruled out investing in Equifax before the ratings change. \u201cThe majority of Wall Street analysts rated the stock a buy before the data breach, and even afterward not many ratings shifted,\u201d Kjellberg said. This chart shows that Equifax\u2019s shares have actually returned 6% over the past year, with dividends reinvested. But you can also see that a strong run for the shares into September reversed very quickly when news of the data breach broke. Half the sell-side analysts polled by FactSet now rate Equifax a buy, while the remaining analysts have neutral ratings on the shares. For those looking for individual investment ideas, we screened the 99 companies the fund was invested in as of Jan. 22 to see which posted the largest sales-per-share increases over the previous 12 reported months. A baker\u2019s dozen increased sales per share by at least 15%: We looked at sales per share, rather than raw revenue, because the per-share numbers reflect any dilution caused by the issuance of additional share. For example, Tesla Inc. sold 1.5 million shares to raise $402.5 million last March. Companies can also issue a lot of new shares to fund acquisitions, so the per-share numbers can help an investor better understand whether the dilution of his or her ownership stake was worth it. You can see that all 13 of the 15%+ sales-per-share growers have had double-digit returns over the past 12 months except for Symantec Corp.  Let\u2019s look ahead at 2018 estimates to see which one of the 13 companies analysts expect to maintain the rapid sales growth: The estimates for fiscal 2017 are actual figures for companies whose fiscal year-end financial information has already been reported. So only seven of the 13 are expected to continue the double-digit sales growth pace this year. Here\u2019s a summary of analyst opinion about these 13 companies, along with price-to-earnings ratios: Sell-side analysts polled by FactSet have majority ratings on eight of the 13. The price-to-earnings ratios compare to a P/E of 18.7 for the S&P 500, based on consensus 2018 earnings estimates, according to FactSet. There\u2019s no P/E for Tesla, as the company is expected to lose $4.10 a share this year. The iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF weights its portfolio according to MSCI\u2019s ESG scores. So if you wish to concentrate on finding investments among companies whose leaders are trying hardest to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d while also making money for their shareholders, you might be interested in the fund\u2019s 10 largest holdings as of Jan. 22: You can click on the tickers for more information about each company, including news, financials and filings.

{"tick": "NVDA", "author": null, "text": "Published: LONDON, January 18, 2018 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ --\nLONDON, January 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Deep in China'sSichuan mountains, miners are chipping away at complex mathematical puzzles in hopes of unlocking one of today's most prized assets, bitcoin. Currently, more than 60 percent of all bitcoin is mined in China, and these miners have picked their location wisely. The remote Sichuan mountains enjoy a cool year-round temperature and cheap electricity provided by small-scale hydro-electric facilities, averaging from $0.05 to $0.08-cents per kWh. \u00a0Recent rumors, however, suggest that this could all come crashing down. \u00a0Included in today's commentary: NNvidia Microsoft Cisco Sytems Intel Corporation Advanced Micro Devices Inc  First reported on , the People's Bank of China outlined a plan behind closed doors aiming to curb the high energy consumption associated with bitcoin mining in the country. The source told Reuters that the PBoC is aiming to force the hand of local governments to limit the miners' electricity in order to gradually scale back the industry's energy consumption. It is important to note that a separate source has since . But this is not the first crackdown conspiracy coming from China. 2017 was wrought with rumors targeting miners, exchanges, and even users of cryptocurrencies. In the wake of yet another market moving story coming out of China, many miners are looking for alternatives. Here are some of the best countries on the planet to mine bitcoin. Canada Canada is a newcomer in the world of crypto-mining, and as Chinese crypto-confusion reaches a boiling point, some miners are choosing to look to the Great White North as an alternative. Patrick Gray, CEO of explains: \"North America is one of the best places in the world for mining, thanks to low cost electricity, cool temperatures, and high-speed internet.\"  is an exciting cryptocurrency mining and blockchain solutions company focusing primarily on mining DASH in Vancouver. \"Dash is the cryptocurrency of the future. It's quicker than its rivals by a factor of several dozen times and thanks to its Sybil-proof decentralized governance - one can really see why they have grown by 9200% in 2017,\" Gray explained, adding \"I am more than confident 2018 will be Dash's top-5 breakthrough year.\" On the other side of the country, Quebec is also looking to lure techies with the dream of striking digital gold.  is offering a unique opportunity for miners and data center operators. With electricity costs at $0.0248 per kWh for data centers, and $0.0394 per kWh for miners, 50 percent to 75 percent lower than comparable areas in North America, the company is scrambling to keep up with demand. \"I have so much demand right now there's no need for marketing. Pretty much every day I have a new one,\" said David Vincent, business development director of Hydro Quebec. Iceland Iceland is quickly becoming a mining paradise. The country offers cool temperatures and an abundance of cheap, geothermal energy to power the rigs. Iceland also provides miners the opportunity to significantly reduce the environmental impact of their endeavors, with 100 percent renewable options.\n\nAlex Karis, CEO of DigitalBTC - the world's first cryptocurrency company to be listed on a major stock exchange - noted: \"We can reduce our energy costs and maintain a low-cost advantage as we grow our mining operations. We have just launched a new product platform and mining is an area we expect to see continued growth.\" DigitalBTC has since the mining race, but others are quickly jumping on board of the Iceland bandwagon. Genesis Mining, a company which offers an opportunity to take part in \"cloud mining,\" a relatively new form of mining that allows users to mine cryptocurrencies without their own hardware, has built the world's largest Ethereum farm in Iceland. The company also manages a large-scale bitcoin mine, and has recently dove into Dash, another cryptocurrency built on bitcoin's feature set. Without the need to build or operate personal mining rigs, users avoid electric bills, confusing software, and the headaches associated with broken hardware or other unforeseen issues. Essentially, Genesis' customers rent mining power from the company, allowing greater participation in what has become a new booming industry. Georgia The Republic of Georgia has taken cryptocurrency adoption to the next level. In addition to the wide-spread usage of cryptocurrencies in the country, Georgia partnered with mining giant BitFury to introduce a blockchain platform to create a property rights registry, and with this, the country became the first in the world to record land titles using blockchain tech. BitFury, one of the world's largest mining and blockchain solutions companies, has made all the right moves within the space. The company's large-scale mining operations are some of the best in the world. It is estimated that BitFury has mined over 600,000 bitcoin to date. The company also pays no tax on its 18 hectares in Tbilisi, and because its services are exported abroad, the company enjoys 18 percent savings on VAT. While BitFury's electricity costs are kept top secret, the average cost of electricity in Tbilisi is around $0.08 per kWh. With little to no taxes paid, and the low cost of electricity, Georgia is one of the world's most profitable cryptocurrency mining locations. Russia Russia country offers some of the cheapest electricity in the world and focuses on less environmentally challenging power generation such as natural gas, nuclear, and hydroelectric, with coal only making up 18 percent of the country's electricity generation, and Russian President Vladimir Putin is reportedly looking to take full advantage of his country's resources. In July 2017, Putin met with Ethereum creator to discuss cryptocurrencies and potential uses for blockchain technology. And following the meeting, Dmitry Marinichev, a trusted ally of Putin, announced plans to build a large-scale cryptocurrency mining operation, expected to cost $100-million. In order to minimize the costs of the operation, the mining equipment will be placed in the homes of private citizens in order to take advantage of Russia's 20 GW power capacity surplus. Marinichev that, with this environment, \"Russia has the potential to reach up to 30 percent share in global cryptocurrency mining in the future.\" Additionally, the Kremlin has suggested that miners are to receive subsidized - \"leftover\"- power. The country's largest energy provider, Gazprom, recently a partnership with EuroSibEnergo set to provide excess power to a number of miners within the Siberian, Urals, and European sections of Russia. The partnership has even created an interactive showing the locations which could benefit from these subsidies. Conclusion As the crypto-craze reaches a full blown frenzy, industry veterans like . and BitFury, and entrepreneurs fresh to the scene such as Hydro Quebec are scrambling to get the best deal possible. In Canada, companies like Hashchain Technology Inc. have the advantage of political stability and a booming startup market. In Iceland, companies like Genesis Mining are using the freezing cold climate to gain an upper hand. In Georgia, BitFury and its competitors have an ideal tax situation and an established blockchain market. In Russia, companies can ride a market that Putin is putting his full weight behind. Other companies in the tech space:  is Nvidia's biggest competitor. The company has developed a cult following among gamers, leading to many a Reddit debate. AMD's groundbreaking technology not only rivals that of Nvidia, some even argue that it outperforms it. As the two square off, one of the key areas to keep an eye on is in the GPU race.   is a leader in multiple fields of technology. The forward-thinking industry giant is the backbone of many laptops and PCs running the Windows operating system. The company has been so successful in its deal-making and advertising that it is impossible to escape its influence.   is one of the most innovative and well-known companies within the tech sector, but its Windows platform is the most widely used operating system on the planet. Like Intel, Microsoft is diving head first into an entirely new market. With key partnerships utilizing and implementing blockchain technology, the company's upside could have huge potential as the tech takes off.   is a major player in telecommunications hardware. With a market cap of more than $185 billion, the company earned $49 billion in 2015 and $48 billion in 2016. For years Cisco was a stable stock, though one that showed very little growth. But in 2018 the company plans on pivoting away from its old staples towards new products.   : The consensus seems to be that this stock is just going to keep climbing. Nvidia is the hottest stock on the market right now, and the top performer across the entire S&P 500. This stock has gone in only one direction-up. One of the biggest causes of the recent spike in share prices, however, is that Nvidia's GPUs are highly prized for cryptocurrency mining.

Zacks Equity Research      (   )\t is anticipated to impress investors once again with its stellar performance in the fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 results which it will report tomorrow after the market closes. Notably, for the last two years, the company\u2019s quarterly revenues have been advancing at a rate more than 50%, earnings have tripled and shares have displayed more than six-fold growth, consequently. This Santa Clara, CA-based chip-making giant is well known for its high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs) used by PC gamers. However, for the last two years, NVIDIA\u2019s strategy of applying its GPUs in the artificial intelligence (AI) models has helped it expand footprint in several fast-growing fields, including self-driving cars and datacenter. AI, which is a global rage these days, has long been touted as the next big thing in the technology sector, with its usage rising gradually with each passing day. Let\u2019s delve deeper and find out how AI is supporting NVIDIA in other growing markets. For the successful operation of autonomous vehicles, a powerful AI supercomputing platform is required. And NVIDIA has successfully innovated the required GPU and became the front runner in providing technology for self-driving vehicles. It should be noted that NVIDIA forayed into the autonomous vehicle and other automotive electronics space by launching a computer vision system at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in 2015. It hasn\u2019t looked back since then and has been continuously bringing in new and more advanced technologies in the space. At the beginning of 2016, NVIDIA launched DRIVE PX 2 \u2014 the world\u2019s most powerful engine for in-vehicle AI. Later in September that year, the graphic-chip behemoth unveiled an AI supercomputer chip designed for self-driving cars called Xavier at its GPU Technology Conference (GTC) in Amsterdam. The company\u2019s AI-enabled GPUs have helped it win several contracts from the auto and component manufacturers. At the CES 2018, the company announced that it has such contracts from more than 300 companies which show NVIDIA\u2019s growing dominance in providing AI platforms which will power future vehicles. The company\u2019s cutting-edge technology has helped it become the leading player in providing AI for applications to autonomous driving vehicles, outpacing other competitors, such as Intel (   )\t and Advanced Micro Devices (   )\t, in terms of growth. Continued contract wins have brought additional revenues. It should be noted that the company\u2019s Automotive segment\u2019s contribution to the total revenues was just $54 million at the end of fiscal 2015, but it is expected to reach approximately $575 million at the end of fiscal 2018. Per the Zacks Consensus Estimate, the Automotive segment\u2019s revenues will be approximately $150 million, representing year-over-year growth of 17%. to know how the company\u2019s overall Q4 performance is expected to be. | NVIDIA is also a leading player in selling its GPUs to datacenter service provider. Its client list includes Amazon (   )\t, Microsoft and Alphabet. Demand for NVIDIA\u2019s datacenter-focused products has escalated due to an increase in datacenter production around the world, and management has successfully marketed its solutions to compete with industry leaders like Intel. Per the Consensus Estimate, the segment is likely to be up 85.5% from the year-ago quarter level and reach $549 million in the fiscal fourth quarter. Apart from self-driving and datacenter markets, increasing use of cryptocurrencies is also driving demand for NVIDIA\u2019s GPUs, as it helps create digital currencies like Ethereum, Monero, Cash and bitcoin gold. As the craze for digital currencies has been growing rapidly, we believe the company will continue to witness demand for its GPUs from miners. Although past performances do not guarantee similar results in the ensuing year, we feel optimistic about the stock given massive growth opportunities in AI and related fields. A few months back, Bank of America Merrill Lynch\u2019s analyst, Vivek Arya, and Evercore ISI\u2019s analyst \u2014 C.J. Muse \u2014 noted that NVIDIA is well poised to dominate the AI market. Arya, in a note written to clients, had mentioned, \u201cSimilar to other large successful tech industries, we expect the $30bn AI chip market to also feature one dominant supplier \u2013 we think NVDA.\u201d Another analyst Mitch Steves of RBC Capital Markets stated that the company is well poised to get the \u201cfirst-mover advantage\u201d and will continue maintaining its sturdy presence in the AI training system. All this makes us optimistic about NVIDIA\u2019s fiscal fourth-quarter performance where its strengthening capabilities in the AI space will be a crucial growth driver.

Shares of ADM moved up over 2% while NVIDIA closed in the red. RDI Initiates Coverage on: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.   NVIDIA Corporation   Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. shares rose 2.38% yesterday on about 62 million shares traded. AMD moved north after an analyst had some positive remarks on the chip maker and said that the company is benefiting more from cryptocurrency then it is letting on. According to Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna Financial Group, he thinks both AMD and NVIDIA \"likely benefited\" from more than $500 million in Ethereum-related sales of their graphics-processing units in the fourth quarter of 2017. Both companies played down the sales in their quarterly earnings. Despite Ethereum dropping, Rolland thinks, \"mining profitability remains among the highest in history.\" He said, \"We believe the confluence of these factors portends upside to both AMD's and NVDA's C4Q17 results (and perhaps 1Q18 guidance). However, we also note substantial longer-term risks for both companies as mining profitability may have induced 'false purchases' of more and higher-priced cards.\" Rolland has a \"neutral\" rating on AMD and has lowered his price target from $15 to $13. Access RDI's Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Research Report at:   NVIDIA Corporation shares closed down 0.12% yesterday on about 10.2 million shares traded. An analyst had some remarks about NVIDIA and AMD and the fact that the two Silicon Valley companies benefited more from Ethereum related sales than they admitted in the fourth quarter of 2017. NVIDIA as well as AMD have graphic cards that are used for mining cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and bitcoin. Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland wrote, \"We believe the confluence of these factors portends upside to both AMD's and NVDA's C4Q17 results (and perhaps 1Q18 guidance).

Shares of Nvidia (   )\t gained nearly 3% in morning trading Wednesday, just one day before the company is scheduled to release its fiscal 2018 fourth-quarter earnings report. The Wall Street darling was hit hard by the recent market-wide sell-off, but the stock is now almost fully recovered\u2014and investors can be sure that the company\u2019s report will attract significant attention. Nvidia has quickly moved to the forefront of the global investing scene over the past two years, largely due to the company\u2019s focus on innovative technology. The Santa Clara, California-based firm manufactures graphics processing units (GPU) and system on a chip units (SoCs) that are considered the top of the line in their respective industries. Nvidia\u2019s traditional business focuses on delivering GPUs to the gaming market and SoCs to the mobile computing market. But over the past few years, its technology has exploded in popularity throughout several budding new industries and is now used in \u201csmart\u201d vehicles, datacenters, cryptocurrency mining, artificial intelligence, and autonomous driving. On the back of growth in these new markets and excitement for what these industries could bring in the future, Nvidia shares have skyrocketed more than 750% over the past two years, including a strong 90% climb over the past 52 weeks. But this share price explosion has also ushered in ludicrous expectations for the company, so the pressure will be on Nvidia to deliver another solid quarterly report tomorrow. Based on our current consensus estimates, we expect management to report adjusted earnings of $1.16 per share and total revenues of $2.67 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 17.2% and 22.8%, respectively. That growth is a bit slower than we have grown to expect from Nvidia, but the company is starting to face tougher prior-year comparisons, which should force investors to adjust a bit. With that said, it is entirely possible that Wall Street hones in on Nvidia\u2019s performance in specific key businesses, as opposed to its overall results. This could be a more effective method for judging the company\u2019s position right now. To prepare for this, we can turn to our exclusive non-financial metrics consensus estimate file. The Zacks Consensus NFM file contains detailed estimate data for business segment metrics and non-financial metrics reported by companies. The data is acquired from digest and contributing broker models and includes the independent research of expert stock market analysts. Investors will rightfully be interested in several of Nvidia\u2019s exciting growth catalysts, but it is also important to track how the company\u2019s core video gaming business is holding up. Our consensus estimate file is calling for Nvidia to report Gaming revenues of $1.581 billion, up about 17.3% from the year-ago period. However, Nvidia notched 25.5% growth in Gaming revenues last quarter, so investors will hope that the company\u2019s holiday shopping season was stronger than analysts are expecting. One division that will likely grow in magnitude over the next few years is the company\u2019s Automotive segment. This is still a relatively small revenue driver, but as the demand for AI-powered autonomous driving grows, Nvidia should stand to benefit. For the fourth quarter, our consensus estimates are calling for Nvidia to report Automotive revenues of $150 million, which would represent year-over-year growth of about 12.2%. Last quarter, Nvidia posted segment revenues of $144 million, up 13.4%, so it looks like growth rates are expected to pick up. Finally, investors are going to want to pay special attention to Nvidia\u2019s Datacenter business, which has been one of its fastest-growing units in recent months. Last quarter, Nvidia reported Datacenter revenues of $501 million, up 108.8% from the year-ago period. Based on our consensus estimates, we expect to see Nvidia post Datacenter revenues of $549 million for Q4. That would represent year-over-year growth of 85.5% from the $296 million that was witnessed last year. 85% growth is certainly nothing to scoff at, but investors have grown accustom to triple-digit Datacenter growth over the past few quarters. This could be a key catalyst for the stock if Nvidia can beat expectations. Make sure to check back here for our full analysis once Nvidia reports tomorrow!

Copyright 2018 Zacks Investment Research At the center of everything we do is a strong commitment to independent research and sharing its profitable discoveries with investors. This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. These returns cover a period from 1988-2016 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, an independent accounting firm. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zack Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

The creation of dynamic content and high-end visuals has enabled the biotech, medical devices, and pharmaceutical industries to exploit the benefits of 3D animation. Animation is being used for maximizing sales, as it enables providers to emphasize and focus on the benefits of products and services by delivering an engaging, educational, and entertaining experience to the viewers.  The increasing use of 3D animation technologies is expected to influence the end-use industries positively. In case of medical science, 3D animation techniques are one of the most effective ways for communication as they display the human body in a polygonal form, which cannot be replicated using photography, sketch, and two-dimensional illustrations.  Traditionally concentrated in the developed countries, the 3D animation market has paved its way into the emerging countries such as India, China, and the Philippines owing to the increasing trend of outsourcing animation activities to these countries. In 2016, the North American region accounted for the largest revenue share of the 3D animation market. However, the Asia Pacific region is expected to witness robust growth throughout the forecast period.    \u2022 The 3D modeling segment is expected to account for the largest revenue share by 2025 and register an estimated CAGR of around 10% over the forecast period \u2022 The visual effects segment was valued at around USD 2.1 billion in 2016, primarily attributed to the increased demand from the media & entertainment industry \u2022 By 2025, the media & entertainment end-use segment is projected to account for around 35% of the total revenue share \u2022 In 2016, the North American region accounted for the largest revenue share and is anticipated to retain its dominance throughout the forecast period \u2022 Asia Pacific is projected to emerge as the fastest growing market since there is a growing emphasis on producing local animated content apart from the outsourced assignments performed by regional firms \u2022 The key players in the industry include Autodesk, Inc., Corel Corporation, Zco Corporation, Adobe Systems Incorporated, NVIDIA Corporation, and NewTek, Inc.

Benjamin Rains        A massive two-day sell-off that created historic volatility in U.S. markets swept across Asia and Europe on Tuesday, and investors are now faced with several key questions: What caused this market pullback? Is it just the beginning of something much worse? Could this be just a blip on the radar of the current Bull Run? To answer these key questions, we need to dig further into the numbers. At one point on Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had fallen 1,597.08 points, which marked its largest ever intraday point slide. The blue-chip average finished the day down 1,175.21 points, marking its biggest one-day point decline on record. As one might assume with such a substantial drop, all 30 companies that make up the index dipped. Yet, due to the historic heights the index reached prior to the sell-off, the point slide was far greater than the percentage dip. The 4.6% decline represented only the largest downturn since . Meanwhile, the S&P 500 shed 113.19 points on Monday, while the Nasdaq Composite also dropped by 3.8%. The Chicago Board of Trade\u2019s Volatility Index, or VIX, which measures market volatility, soared well over 100%, marking its largest one-day climb on record (also read: ). Still, many worse single days have occurred, and a full market \u201ccorrection\u201d means a 10% drop from a peak, which is something that many analysts and investors have been preparing for amid a torrid climb that saw the S&P skyrocket 32% since the presidential election. With only a few days to analyze this current sell-off, analysts have had a hard time trying to pinpoint exactly what might be causing this rush to liquidate market-driven gains. With that said, there are more than a few possibilities, and it is quite possible all of them, or none of them, turn out to be the real driving forces. Notably, speculation surrounding the cost of borrowing going up is one possible catalyst that might have led to this sell-off. The Bureau of Labor Statistics released strong wage data last Friday, which noted that the U.S. economy created 200,000 new jobs in January. The BLS also reported that wages rose by 2.9% on an annualized basis. This better-than-expected job and wage growth led to worries that the Fed will raise interest rates more aggressively than previously anticipated in order to curb possible inflation. Additionally, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes hit a four-year high on of 2.85% Friday. That benchmark yield rested at 2.76 % as of 1 p.m. EST on Tuesday, signaling that some investors have slowly pulled their money out of U.S. government debt, which often becomes a safe-haven during market sell-offs. Furthermore, the current ubiquity of automated algorithmic trading might also have played a role in this large sell-off. Algorithms that now control a large portion of trading are often programmed to buy and sell based on certain triggers like specific price points. A snowball effect could have started when \u201csell\u201d level warnings were reached across markets. On top of that, the prevalence of exchange-traded funds, which allow investors to trade stocks that are actually a bundle of other stocks\u2014akin to mutual funds\u2014added to the sell-off. Another reason, which \u2019s , is the influx of first-time investors who entered the market during the historic climb. Cramer noted that many of these investors panicked and rushed to sell. Several major U.S. brokerage firms experienced major on Tuesday amid a third-straight day of volatile trading. Fidelity and TD Ameritrade (   )\t both experienced either complete temporary crashes or massive slowdowns on their online platforms. Today, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin that he is \u201cnot overly concerned about the market volatility\u201d and that the fundamentals remain \u201cquite strong.\u201d This is part of a growing sentiment among many financial experts who think the recent sell-off was simply a brief market pullback to help recalibrate lofty valuations and sky-high P/E ratios that began to run rampant across the S&P. Zacks Executive Vice President Kevin Matras said as much in an email to clients on Tuesday. Matras pointed to the recent tax cuts and overall consumer confidence as evidence that the economy is humming along. This is not to say that the current sell-off will stop abruptly, but it seems that sentiment among many in the investing world is that some of the biggest companies simply climbed too far too fast, and it was time to reel in some gains. As of midday, tech giants Micron (   )\t, Netflix (   )\t, Nvidia (   )\t, Apple (   )\t, and Amazon (   )\t were all up over 2%. It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market. Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it. If you don't buy now, you may kick yourself in 2020.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. These returns cover a period from 1988-2016 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, an independent accounting firm. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zack Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

Technology is quickly changing the world, and owners of the companies doing the changing are reaping big rewards. New businesses are often privately held, though, excluding all but a select few investors. For those who want in on some of the hottest tech names today, there is a back way in by investing in Japan's . refers to the practice of buying and funding privately owned companies -- those that do not have shares listed on a stock exchange that investors can purchase. In the technology industry, some of the fastest growing businesses today are privately held, funding their expansion with private equity from big investors in exchange for an equity stake. These sometimes-lucrative deals are off-limits to most investors, though. Because of the extra risks that often accompany private companies -- like requirements to not sell for long time periods, limited parties to sell a stake to, and sometimes-unprofitable operations -- the Securities and Exchange Commission has put stringent requirements on who can participate. You have to be an accredited investor, satisfying at least one of the following: a net worth of $1 million, excluding the value of a primary residence, or income for at least two years of a minimum $200,000 if single and $300,000 combined if married. Those definitions exclude most, but there is another way to get access to some of today's fastest-growing private tech: SoftBank, which operates the largest technology investment fund ever. Softbank's business has been looking increasingly high-tech through acquisitions and new business segments. Image source: Softbank. SoftBank is one of Japan's largest telecom operators. The company has also diversified into other businesses and owns stakes in , operates Yahoo! Japan, and owns semiconductor maker ARM Holdings. SoftBank is also the operator of the Vision Fund, which has also received investments from the likes of , , and sovereign wealth from the United Arab Emirates. Vision Fund raised $100 billion and has already taken stakes in companies spanning the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, mobile apps, financial technology, and biotechnology. Here is a breakdown of some of the biggest deals: $8.5 billion SoftBank gets 15% of Uber, and its investment partners 3%. Uber took a 30% hit to its valuation in the deal. $8.2 billion SoftBank transferred 25% of its ARM Holdings subsidiary to Vision Fund. $5 billion The stake in NVIDIA is reportedly worth $5 billion, also transferred to Vision Fund from SoftBank. $4.4 billion It provides shared work space and other services for start-ups. $2.5 billion A leading e-commerce platform in India. $1.2 billion Also expected to be offered to Vision Fund by SoftBank. OneWeb is a satellite-based internet service provider. $1.1 billion A drug holding company that builds subsidiary businesses around late-stage drugs and therapies. $1 billion An online retailer of sports merchandise. $1 billion Another SoftBank subsidiary that could be offered to Vision Fund, this one an online personal finance company. $500 million China's first online-only insurance company. $500 million A video game and virtual-world development start-up. $500 million A company focused on fighting infectious disease like HIV and influenza. $460 million An online car dealer based in Germany. $450 million An online real estate company connecting owners with buyers and renters. $360 million The company develops blood-based tests for early cancer detection. $300 million An on-demand dog walking and care app. $250 million A budget hotel network based in India. $250 million Cloud-based software to help teams collaborate at work online. $200 million An indoor farming start-up. Chart by author. Data source: Softbank press releases, Recode, and TechCrunch. Vision Fund's tech holdings are diverse, and with the exception of NVIDIA, all privately held. For owners of SoftBank's stock, you get ownership of those businesses by way of the telecom's control over the fund. The company earns big fees from Vision Fund, especially if those investments keep growing. Some caution is needed, though. Private equity is not for the faint of heart, as these companies can be volatile. Since they are not publicly traded, private deals can change the valuations very quickly (like what just happened with ) and dilute existing shareholder values. SoftBank is also mulling over spinning off a portion of its to investors, sharpening its focus as an investor in technology and start-ups. Investors thinking about buying SoftBank should be aware that what they are buying is not the same thing as a typical publicly traded company, but more like a private equity fund. However, if high-risk, potentially big-reward private equity is what you're after, SoftBank could be your ticket.

This week, some of the most popular and hottest names on Wall Street will report earnings including companies in the restaurant industry, social media, manufacturing and retail. Most of these companies have good track records of beating, which isn\u2019t easy to do. Two of them haven\u2019t missed in over 5 years. Will the recent stock market volatility play a factor in the trade after these companies report? Or will they be able to overcome stock market weakness to keep their upward momentum intact? 1. only went IPO in 2017. Doesn\u2019t it seem like it has been public for much longer? It\u2019s beat 2 out of the last 3 quarters but shares have sunk since the IPO. It\u2019s expected to lose 63 cents in 2017 and another 54 cents in 2018. Revenue growth is key. 2. hasn\u2019t missed in 5 years but shares sank to a multi-year low in 2017 on worries that retail, even in the luxury category, was going to be Amazoned. But results started to turn around late last year and the shares are off the lows. At 16x earnings, is there still a buying opportunity? 3. was spun-off from the parent, Yum, in 2016. It owns KFC and Pizza Hut in China. It is coming off its first miss as a public company last quarter. Shares have skyrocketed in 2018, however, as many think the Chinese consumer is back spending again. Are shares too hot to handle? 4. makes auto diagnostic tools. It has a great track record of beating, having done so for 5 years, but shares have stalled the last few years. Is a true breakout coming? 5. is considered one of the \u201cjunior\u201d FANGs, as it\u2019s an \u201cN\u201d named stock like Netflix and shares soared in 2017. It has only missed one time in the last 5 years but is now trading with a forward P/E of 49. Can it keep of its tremendous momentum? It could become the mother of all technological revolutions. Apple sold a mere 1 billion iPhones in 10 years but a new breakthrough is expected to generate more than 27 billion devices in just 3 years, creating a $1.7 trillion market. Zacks has just released a Special Report that spotlights this fast-emerging phenomenon and 6 tickers for taking advantage of it. If you don't buy now, you may kick yourself in 2020.

Investors around the world have begrudgingly welcomed back volatility to the global markets over the past few trading periods, as a market-wide sell-off erased the year-to-date gains of most major indexes and raised questions about the stability of our red-hot bull market. Conditions appear to have stabilized a bit on Tuesday, but it is probably still too soon to declare a bottom on this correction. It is also worth noting that this sell-off happened in spite of what has been a strong earnings season. We have moved past the busy stretch of Q4 report season, but a few marquee reports remain to come over the next few days, and strong results in these quarterly summaries could help inspire a market-wide rebound. With that said, the best way for investors to benefit from this possible recovery is to target companies that are likely to outperform earnings estimates. Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago. A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. Today, we are giving our readers a very special treat: a free look at three of the strongest stocks that are popping up on our Earnings ESP Screener right now. Check them out: (   ) Taylor Morrison is a homebuilder and land developer engaged in building single-family detached and attached homes. The company is scheduled to release its latest quarterly results before the market opens on Feb. 7. TMHC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of 4.89%. Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect to see Taylor Morrison report earnings of 70 cents per share and revenues of $1.28 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 7.69% and 6.68%, respectively.  (   ) iRobot is the leading global consumer robot company. Best known for its Roomba automated vacuums, iRobot develops several in-home robotic devices. The company is slated to announce its latest quarterly results after the market closes on Feb. 7. IRBT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of 17.65%. According to our latest consensus estimates, iRobot is projected to report earnings of 26 cents per share and revenues of $317.31 million. That earnings figure would represent a steep slump of 46.94% from the year-ago period, but revenues are expected to improve by 49.33%.  (   ) Nvidia the worldwide leader in graphics processors. The firm produces processors used for gaming, datacenters, autonomous driving, commercial visualization, and more. Nvidia is scheduled to release its latest quarterly report after the bell on Feb. 8. NVDA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an earnings ESP of 4.13%. Our current consensus estimates are calling for Nvidia to report adjusted earnings of $1.16 per share and revenues of $2.66 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 17.17% and 22.35%, respectively.  It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

{"tick": "NVDA", "author": null, "text": "Published: ALBANY, New York, February 7, 2018 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ --\nALBANY, New York, February 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- A recent business intelligence publication by Transparency Market Research (TMR) notifies that while startups are mushrooming in the , the competitive landscape remains moderately consolidated among a few players. The analysts of the report have identified NVIDIA Corporation and INTEL Corporation as the top two companies who were ahead of the curve in 2016, whereas Google Inc., Qualcomm Incorporated, IBM Corporation, CEVA Inc., Xilinx, Graphcore, Teradeep Inc., and Advanced Micro Devices are some of the other notable companies currently harnessing the prospects of deep learning.   Since the entry barriers of this market are not incredibly high and heavily dependent on technologies that are not patented, startups have a strong chance to make a mark. In the near future, the shares in the global deep learning chipset are expected to head towards a fragmented scenario, although most of the prominent chip manufacturers are anticipated to hold onto their position of strength. Market leaders are expected to frequently indulge into acquisition and collaboration activities with startups with niche concepts. For instance, in January 2016, Google Inc. agreed to collaborate with Movidius to enhance its deep learning portfolio on mobile devices, which was later acquired by Intel Corporation. Later in August the same year, Intel Corporation also acquired Nervana Systems in order to further solidify its position in developing the hardware chipsets platform.     If the projections of the TMR report are to be believed, the demand in the global deep learning chipset market will increment at a phenomenal CAGR of 24.7% during the forecast period of 2017 to 2025. The report has estimated that from its calculated worth of merely US$150.17 mn in 2015, the opportunities in the global deep learning market will translate into a revenue of US$1,264.78 mn by the end of 2025. Based on type, the TMR report segments the global deep learning chipset market into application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and others. Compute capacity bifurcation of the market has been done into low (less than 1 TFlops) and high (greater than 1 TFlops). End-user classification of the market has been done into automotive, consumer electronics, healthcare, industrial, aerospace and defense, and others. Geographically, the analysts have detected that although North America currently provides for the maximum chunk of demand, the region of Asia Pacific will overtake in terms of demand and revenue by the end of 2025.      The global deep learning chipset market is primarily driven by significant improvements in the chip algorithms in the last few year, which has enormously increased their ability to consume and manage data efficiently. With increasing adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) that promises to connect billions of new devices and pertaining data streams, it is very likely that much more digital data will be generated and consequently, the industry of machine learning and deep learning will flourish. Moreover, newly build algorithms are shifting the learning from one particular application to another application, making it easily possible for the machines to learn from very fewer examples. Invention of a related computer chip, which is known as GPU or graphic processing unit, is turning out to be very meaningful and effective when it is being applied to types of calculations required for neural nets. Speed up of 10x times are also very much viable when the neural nets will move from traditional CPU to GPU.

{"tick": "NVDA", "author": "Nigam Arora", "text": "Published: Stocks will rise in the short term, but investors will be worse off in the long term By No politician in the United States wants Americans to be worse off and deliberately take steps that are bad for an average American investor. However the policy of destroying the dollar, though well-intentioned, will lead to American investors being worse off in the long term. In the short term, investors are celebrating a lower dollar. But it is also prudent to start thinking of defensive steps to preserve wealth. The dollar fell to a three-year low after comments by the Treasury Secretary Mnuchin on Wednesday in support of a weaker dollar. It was the biggest one-day fall in 10 months. Before his inauguration, President Trump declared that the dollar was too strong. This started the decline in the dollar. But Mnuchin\u2019s comment is like drilling a hole in a dam that is holding back a flood. Initially after the hole is drilled, only a small amount of water flows out. But if the hole is not repaired or more holes are drilled, pretty soon the dam loses its structural integrity and causes a flood. In this case if the flood happens, it will be average investors losing money in the stock market, like they did in 2008 and 2000. I am politically agnostic. My sole focus is to help investors. My longtime readers know that I have often expressed opinions that were unpopular at the time. To understand this minority opinion, let\u2019s start with a chart. Please for an annotated chart of the Dollar Index Bullish Fund that represents the dollar index Please note the following from the chart: \u2022 The major support is far below where it is trading now. This means from a technical perspective, there is still a lot of room for the dollar to fall farther. \u2022 Before the present fall, a pattern of lower lows was already established. \u2022 After lower lows, the rally failed. \u2022 Now there is another lower low after Treasury Secretary Mnuchin\u2019s comment. \u2022 Collectively all this paints a very bearish picture for the dollar. However in the short term the dollar is very oversold and a bounce up is typical.   In the short term, a weaker dollar is good for stocks, as the earnings of the companies that are in S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Index go up. This is reflected in the moves in broad-based ETFs such as the SPDR S&P 500 ETF and the PowerShares QQQ  Earnings of popular tech stocks will also go up because they derive a significant portion of revenue from abroad. Examples of companies benefiting are Apple Facebook Alphabet  Netflix Nvidia and AMD     Gold and silver are priced in dollars. For this reason they generally move inversely to the dollar\u2019s moves. The SPDR Gold Shares ETF and the iShares Silver Trust ETF have moved up on the weaker dollar. Also moving up are ETFs for precious metal miners junior gold miners and leveraged gold miners  Just like gold, oil is also priced in dollars. When the dollar moves down, oil generally goes up. ETFs of interest are the U.S.Oil Fund and VelocityShares 3x Long Crude Oil ETNs  Here are the reasons why a lower dollar is bad for average American investors in the long term: \u2022 The dollar has been the world\u2019s reserve currency. This has allowed the U. S. to engage in both fiscal and monetary policies that have benefited American investors. A lower dollar endangers the reserve currency status. \u2022 Would you buy stock in a company where the management is actively seeking ways to lower the price of the stock? A country is no different. The United States government is actively seeking to lower the value of the dollar. Would you want to hold the dollar? \u2022 As other countries start questioning the value of holding the dollar, it will negatively impact the dollar\u2019s status as a reserve currency. \u2022 The United States is a highly indebted country. A large portion of the debt is financed by foreigners. Why would foreigners want to buy U.S. debt when the value of the dollar is falling? \u2022 If the demand by foreigners for buying the U.S. debt wanes, interest rates will go up. \u2022 The United States is a big importer. As the dollar weakens, the cost of the imports will go up. This will cause inflation. \u2022 Rapidly rising inflation is bad for the stock market. \u2022 To control rapidly rising inflation, the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates. \u2022 Rapidly rising interest rates are bad for the stock market. \u2022 Foreigners now buy a significant amount of U.S. stocks. With the dollar falling, foreigners will have less reason to buy U.S. stocks. This will be bad for the stock market. Investors ought to start thinking about assets that aren\u2019t dependent on the U. S. economy and also about assets that benefit from a lower dollar in the long term.

{"tick": "NVDA", "author": "Emily Bary", "text": "Published: The company\u2019s data-centric businesses grew 21% in the holiday quarter, while the PC business shrunk slightly By Intel Corp. shares rose more than 10% to its highest per-share prices since 2000 Friday, its largest one-day gain in almost nine years, after a strong earnings report led multiple analysts to raise their price targets. The chip giant late Thursday and also reported December-quarter revenue ahead of consensus estimates. Investors were also pleased to hear management say that to have \u201cany material impact\u201d on product costs, though the company updated its risk factors to include the possibility of the security exploits affecting results.   Analysts heaped praise on the company, particularly its cloud-focused businesses, and helped shares rise 10.6% to $50.08 at the close. At least 20 analysts boosted their price targets, though there were no upgrades as nearly two-thirds of analysts who cover the stock already rate it a buy, according to FactSet. \u201cWe continue to believe Intel\u2019s diversification toward data-centric businesses and continued focus on increasing operational efficiencies markets are driving the company toward faster longer-term revenue growth at stronger profitability margins,\u201d wrote MKM Partners analyst Ruben Roy, who upped his price target to $55 from $50. The company\u2019s data-centric businesses accounted for 47% of Intel\u2019s total revenue in the latest quarter after posting 21% revenue growth, while the firm\u2019s PC-centric businesses witnessed a small decline. CFO Robert Swan said on the earnings conference call that Intel expects midteens growth for the data-centric segment over the course of the year. \u201cWe see continued positive trends as Xeon Scalable (Skylake) is at the early stages of its product ramp,\u201d JP Morgan analyst Harlan Sur wrote in commenting on the data-center business. He also raised his price target on the stock to $55, from $53 previously. Sur added: \u201cWe see the team continuing to drive outsized growth in non-PC segments (especially data center as cloud service provider spending is estimated to grow at a 20%+ CAGR over the next few years), continuing to expand its presence in new markets and drive margin expansion higher over the next few years.\u201d Susquehanna\u2019s Christopher Rolland was intrigued by the company removing the gross margin forecast from its annual outlook \u201cfor the first time\u201d and relegating it to \u201csmall font in the CFO presentation.\u201d Meanwhile, Intel gave more prominent mention to its operating margins. The company predicts a 3 percentage-point decline in gross margins for the first quarter and flat operating margins. \u201cWe believe this purposeful reporting change signifies a strong and sustained ramp in memory (multiyear) as a greater mix of NAND would be dilutive to gross margins, but potentially accretive to operating margins,\u201d Rolland wrote, while hiking his price target to $54 from $48. \u201cWhile the old adage is that \u2018Intel stock follows gross margins,\u2019 we find this belief somewhat silly as we feel EPS (or better yet \u2018owner\u2019s earnings\u2019/share) is a far better indicator.\u201d   Intel\u2019s outlook for the current quarter was generally in line with consensus views, but numerous analysts thought that this shouldn\u2019t be cause for panic. \u201cOur initial take is that guidance is conservative with the potential for upside,\u201d Rolland wrote. Instinet\u2019s Romit Shah added: \u201cIntel has a history of issuing conservative guidance.\u201d Still, not all were convinced of further price appreciation going forward. In a note titled \u201cGrowth Ain\u2019t Cheap,\u201d Oppenheimer\u2019s Rick Schafer wrote, \u201cwe are encouraged to see non-PC exposure tracking toward ~50% of revenue, but earnings and free-cash-flow leverage/growth remain limited, keeping us sidelined here.\u201d He has a perform rating on shares. Intel\u2019s strong quarter lifted other chip stocks as well, with shares of Advanced Micro Devices Inc. rising 3.4% and shares of Nvidia Corp. rising 2.2% Friday. Intel shares are up 33% over the past 12 months, while the S&P 500 index has gained 24% and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index has soared 44%.

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: was the Bull of the Day back on and then again on .\u00a0 Following the recent earnings, it is again the Bull of the Day. PetMed Express is a pet pharmacy in the United States. The company markets prescription and non-prescription pet medications, health products, and supplies for dogs and cats to retail customers. PetMed Express was founded in 1996 and is headquartered in Delray Beach, Florida. Back on September 7, I filmed this video which focuses on Aggressive Growth stocks. You can access the video on this page and also hear about CROX as well. I should note that I made it my Top Stock Pick of the Week ( ) so be sure to watch that video too! The stock is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) because earnings estimates have moved higher. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2018 has moved from $1.61 to $1.70. over the last sixty days. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2019 also increased over the same time period. The number moved from $1.67 to $1.94. There is a huge short interest in this stock. That means that investors believe that the stock will move lower and they have borrowed shares, sold them and hope to buy them back lower. Thing is, the short is not working. The site ShortSqueeze.com shows that the float is 27% short... and that is a huge amount of shorts. As fundamentals continue to improve, the shorts are more likely to cover their bets and take a loss. This is could be a classic short squeeze. : recently reported earnings and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.\u00a0 Revenues were in line, but they declined on a year over year basis.\u00a0 This is not what investors want to see and this stock is now a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the Bear of the Day. Beazer Homes is a homebuilder in the United States. The company designs, constructs, and sells single-family and multi-family homes for entry-level, move-up, or retirement-oriented home buyers under the Beazer Homes brand name. It sells its homes through commissioned new home sales counselors and independent brokers in Arizona, California, Nevada, Texas, Delaware, Indiana, Maryland, Tennessee, Virginia, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Beazer Homes USA, Inc. was founded in 1985 and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. Following the recent miss, numbers have dropped.\u00a0 These aren\u2019t just any numbers, these are earnings estimates. Investors around the world have begrudgingly welcomed back volatility to the global markets over the past few trading periods, as a market-wide sell-off erased the year-to-date gains of most major indexes and raised questions about the stability of our red-hot bull market. Conditions appear to have stabilized a bit on Tuesday, but it is probably still too soon to declare a bottom on this correction. It is also worth noting that this sell-off happened in spite of what has been a strong earnings season. We have moved past the busy stretch of Q4 report season, but a few marquee reports remain to come over the next few days, and strong results in these quarterly summaries could help inspire a market-wide rebound. With that said, the best way for investors to benefit from this possible recovery is to target companies that are likely to outperform earnings estimates. Luckily, Zacks Premium customers can utilize the in order to search for stocks that are expected to beat. Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst estimates. This is done because, generally speaking, when an analyst posts an estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago. A positive Earnings ESP paired with a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better ranking helps us feel confident about the potential for an earnings beat. In fact, our 10-year backtest has revealed that this methodology has accurately produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. Today, we are giving our readers a very special treat: a free look at three of the strongest stocks that are popping up on our Earnings ESP Screener right now. Check them out: Taylor Morrison is a homebuilder and land developer engaged in building single-family detached and attached homes. The company is scheduled to release its latest quarterly results before the market opens on Feb. 7. TMHC is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of 4.89%. Based on our latest consensus estimates, we expect to see Taylor Morrison report earnings of 70 cents per share and revenues of $1.28 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth of 7.69% and 6.68%, respectively. iRobot is the leading global consumer robot company. Best known for its Roomba automated vacuums, iRobot develops several in-home robotic devices. The company is slated to announce its latest quarterly results after the market closes on Feb. 7. IRBT is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has an Earnings ESP of 17.65%. According to our latest consensus estimates, iRobot is projected to report earnings of 26 cents per share and revenues of $317.31 million. That earnings figure would represent a steep slump of 46.94% from the year-ago period, but revenues are expected to improve by 49.33%. Nvidia the worldwide leader in graphics processors. The firm produces processors used for gaming, datacenters, autonomous driving, commercial visualization, and more. Nvidia is scheduled to release its latest quarterly report after the bell on Feb. 8. NVDA is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an earnings ESP of 4.13%. Our current consensus estimates are calling for Nvidia to report adjusted earnings of $1.16 per share and revenues of $2.66 billion. These results would represent year-over-year growth rates of 17.17% and 22.35%, respectively. It could become the mother of all technological revolutions.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report. That is because NVIDIA Corporation is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat.

{"tick": "NVDA", "author": "Ryan Shrout", "text": "Published: Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies might be the first and biggest opportunity By AMD to run the business responsible for its graphics chips and architecture. They face a steep challenge as they seek to catch rival graphics giant Nvidia, update the AMD graphics roadmap and develop products that will increase revenue and market share through 2020. Without a direction for the growing artificial intelligence and machine-learning markets as well as the core gaming segment, the AMD graphics division appears to be vulnerable. Mike Rayfield will operate the business portion of the graphics business unit, coming from Micron with a previous stint at Nvidia. David Wang returns to lead the engineering and technology portion; he had helped with AMD graphics development for a decade before moving to Synaptics in 2012. They replace Raja Koduri, who left for Intel to build from the ground up, while also managing the CPU design group. That puts added pressure on AMD to develop new products that could close the gap with Nvidia before Intel can get up to speed. The question for AMD\u2019s Radeon Technologies Group is how quickly it can do that under the new leadership. Though business practices, partnerships, and policy can be adjusted, if the fundamental architecture that powers its graphics products is lacking and needs to be redesigned, that can be as much as a three-year task. If the chip design is solid and only minor changes to be made, it is still a full year of work before any input Wang might have can be implemented. There is no technical reason that I see for a full redesign of the architecture, so it seems more likely a minor cleanup is all that is needed. As a first step, I would expect Mayfield and Wang to provide investors with a new roadmap within three months. At the company\u2019s CES event for media and analysts earlier this month, the roadmap was vague and open-ended, leaving many gaps between now and 2020. The only announcement was for a revised graphics chip for machine learning that would be sampling in small quantities to customers in 2018, but no timeline for production or revenue was given. The gap between AMD and Nvidia graphics technology remains complex. Nvidia has the dominant position in machine learning over not just AMD but every other competitor. AMD has the advantage of being the only other company with a robust graphics IP portfolio, but the work Nvidia has done with the development community and in software tools to make that development easier has paid off. AMD\u2019s first goal should be addressing this space, both with updated graphics products and an increased investment in its software stack.    On the gaming side, Nvidia hasn\u2019t been able to grab significantly more market share from AMD (it\u2019s up 2% year over year) despite arguably having the better products. Thanks in part to the consistent demand driven by cryptocurrency mining, AMD is able to sell every graphics card it can build. It\u2019s basically a race between the two to produce more graphics cards. There is a need for balance and control on that side as overproduction during a crypto-crash could result in inventory without a market to sell to. But cryptocurrencies might be the first and biggest opportunity for the AMD unit\u2019s new leadership. Nvidia has continually shied away from being known as a cryptomining chip provider, despite all indications that consumers and investors are buying a large percentage of Nvidia graphics chips for exactly that. There is risk, but if AMD were to lean into the space and create a unique spin, something that combined the benefits of gaming and mining into a single product, it could result in a quick spike in revenue. Both AMD and Nvidia are trying to find ways to improve margins with the graphics card shortage (most of that additional income has gone to resellers and the channel). AMD should also direct more energy and resources on its combined processor-graphics chips called APUs (accelerated processing unit). As the need for alternative solutions for PC gamers has grown, AMD is unique with its ability to offer products with both high-performance processor cores and high-performance graphics. Focusing on that product line would create a space for AMD to market to that neither Nvidia nor Intel have the ability to address.    The key points that AMD\u2019s new graphics leadership team has to address are clear. Get the roadmap and architecture back on track to compete with Nvidia long-term. Provide partners with a reason to believe that the company can compete in the machine learning and artificial intelligence spaces that are providing extreme growth opportunities for the competition. Extend the software infrastructure to draw in developers to use the AMD graphics-chip-based solutions for these machine-learning applications. Develop a plan to take advantage of the near-term cryptocurrency mining demand while also buffering the company from the potential pitfalls of a bitcoin crash. Double down on the PC gaming space to grow the install base and build brand excitement.

{"tick": "NVDA", "author": "Philip van Doorn", "text": "Published: Measuring the S&P: 23% of its components are up at least 10% so far in 2018 while 35 are in the red By One might have thought the stage was set for another excellent year for U.S. stocks after in December. But you might not have expected the market to move so dramatically. Netflix is far and away the early leader in the S&P 500\u2019s broad rally this year. The index has returned 6.3% during the first 17 trading sessions of 2018, through Jan. 25, with dividends reinvested, adding to its remarkable return of 21.8% in 2017. (The S&P 500 actually comprises 505 stocks, because several companies have more than one class of common shares included in the index.) The index has closed at a record 13 times this month, the most records for any calendar month since February 1998.    And it may be time to put some perspective on every time the Dow Jones Industrial Average rises by another 1,000 points. After all, a 1,000-point gain from its last milestone of 26,000 on Jan. 17 would be gain of 4%. That\u2019s lovely, but not dramatic. The Dow is up 6.9% this year (and has set 10 record closes), following last year\u2019s return of 21.8%. Among the S&P\u2019s 505 components: \u2022 117 have had double-digit total returns. \u2022 232 have beaten the market with total returns of 6.4% or more. \u2022 408 have shown positive returns. \u2022 One is flat. That would be Celgene Corp. which reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results on Jan. 25 after announcing on Jan. 22 an agreement to acquire Juno Therapeutics Inc. for $9 billion. \u2022 96 are down. \u2022 35 are down 5% or more, including five that are down 10% or more. For 2018, many professional investors expect a healthy environment for the energy sector, because of strong demand for oil brought about by accelerating growth in all major world economies. West Texas Intermediate crude oil has risen 8% this year, to $65.51 a barrel as of the close on Jan. 24. Jim Brilliant, who manages the CM Advisors Fixed Income Fund said in an interview that simultaneous economic growth around the world will signal a \u201crotation\u201d for stocks away from higher-growth industries into . Here\u2019s how the 11 sectors of the S&P 500 have performed through Jan. 25: It may not be a surprise to see the real estate and utilities sectors showing the worst performance so far this year, as investors these income-generating sectors generally decline when interest rates rise. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes rose to 2.63% on Jan. 25 from 2.40% at the end of 2017. Here are the 27 S&P 500 stocks that have returned 15% or more this year through Jan. 25: You can click the tickers for more information, including news coverage, price ratios, financials and filings. Netflix Inc. is the runaway winner, returning 40%, with investors cheering the company\u2019s . The stock closed at $269.70 on Jan. 25 and traded for 117.3 times the consensus 2018 earnings estimate of $2.30 a share. That\u2019s a remarkably high forward price-to-earnings ratio. Then again, Netflix is always expensive, and if the company can continue growing its sales at a 30%+ pace, you can expect the stock to maintain a high valuation to earnings. Two-thirds of sell-side analysts rate the stock a buy, according to FactSet. But the consensus price target is $258.86, showing the analysts as a group don\u2019t expect the stock to rise from here over the next 12 months.   \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Here are the 35 worst-performing S&P 500 stocks:    Philip van Doorn covers various investment and industry topics.

Notably, the Internet services and online marketing solutions provider for small businesses delivered an average positive earnings surprise of 3.85% in the trailing four quarters. Last quarter, the company delivered GAAP earnings of 16 cents per share compared with 7 cents in the year-ago quarter. Moreover, Web.com reported revenues of $189.8 million, slightly better than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $189 million. However, the figure declined 1.6% on a year-over-year basis. For fourth-quarter 2017, Web.com projects non-GAAP revenues between $188.5 million and $191.5 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $190.8 million.   |  Web.com\u2019s top line is likely to benefit from increasing brand awareness. During the quarter, the company launched its new website that enhances customer experience. Moreover, the company\u2019s focus on higher-ARPU and differentiated value-added solutions are expected to drive the top line. Retail business is expected to be strong on the back of robust demand for security and e-mail products. Management noted that post the Equifax breach, security has become imperative for small businesses to have a successful online presence. Web.com\u2019s simple-to-use security products and consultative approach is likely to boost sales of the security products. Moreover, the completion of the Yodle integration is likely to bolster Lead Stream and vertical market solution results. Additionally, strong demand for real estate solution TORCHx is expected to drive conversion and retention rate, which will eventually boost total revenues. The company\u2019s strategic partnerships with RE/MAX (one of the largest real estate brokerage franchisors) and Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices are expected to boost TORCHx\u2019s adoption rate. We also expect robust performance from Lighthouse 360 and Web Brand Networks (WBN) to drive quarterly results. Notably, Web.com has been undertaking strategic acquisitions to boost operations. The company\u2019s acquisition of Donweb.com last year and Scoot in 2014 will continue to accelerate overseas expansion. However, an increasingly competitive business environment is a major concern. Moreover, declining subscriber base is a headwind. Web.com stated that overall retention rate may decline due to the increased mix shift towards value-added services subscribers who inherently have a higher churn rate than low-cost domain customers.

Mettler-Toledo has an impressive earnings surprise history. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimates in each of the last four quarters, with an average positive surprise of 3.49%.  |  In third-quarter 2017, adjusted earnings of $4.36 per share beat the consensus mark by 6 cents and increased 12% year over year. In the last quarter, net revenues of $653.7 million were up 7.5% year over year, on solid growth in Laboratory and Industrial segments. The company\u2019s strong product pipeline along with Field Turbo investments, marketing initiatives and Spinnaker sales drove the results. For fourth-quarter 2017, Mettler-Toledo expects local currency sales to grow approximately 5.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $764.7 million. Moreover, adjusted earnings are expected to grow 12% to $5.90 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased by a penny to $5.94 in the last 30 days. Mettler-Toledo\u2019s dominant market position is a key catalyst.

Moreover, the China market has recovered and is likely to boost Mettler-Toledo\u2019s sales from industrial business segment. In the third quarter, Mettler-Toledo acquired Biotix, a manufacturer and distributor of laboratory consumables and liquid handling solutions to the life science market. The acquisition helped the company gain access to indirect distribution channels with robust secondary brands.

{"tick": "NVDA", "author": "Ryan Shrout", "text": "Published: Skyrocketing price of graphic cards and system memory is bad news for do-it-yourself consumers and PC gamers By The price of graphic cards and system memory is skyrocketing thanks to the continued rise in demand for the chips to handle cryptocurrency mining. That\u2019s bad news for the large market of do-it-yourself consumers and PC gamers \u2014 and an opportunity for vendors like HP Dell, Lenovo  and others to gain increased revenue and new customers for both notebooks and desktop PCs. Computers built by brand-name manufacturers, known as OEMs, frequently have fixed-priced agreements on key components that insulate them from both today\u2019s higher prices \u2014 sometimes twice as much as the suggested retail price \u2014 and product shortages. Traditionally, the cost of an OEM PC is higher than a DIY build due to warranty, support, and labor overhead. But because of the price spikes for graphics cards and memory, these OEMs can now offer systems at lower prices that the DIY market can. Systems at retailers are often selling for $300 less than comparable DIY configurations. The result is that gamers and PC buyers that would have previously never considered an off-the-shelf system are looking in that direction for computer hardware. It is not only desktop PCs that are seeing this increased interest. Gaming notebooks also look significantly more appealing to gamers in need of a new system or upgrade but who refuse to pay the higher prices they find online for individual PC components. Vendors like HP, Dell (with its Alienware brand), Lenovo and lesser-known brands like ASUS and Acer have been selling gaming-centric notebook computers for many years, but the market has been small relative to the rest of the mobile PC market. The shifts in demand for desktop components are now driving more gamers into this space than ever before. To take advantage of this shift, marketing and product teams at these OEMs should be targeting this group of outcast consumers. Branding and messaging that showcases the newly acquired \u201cvalue\u201d angle for these desktops and notebooks could go a long way to creating a new customer that translates into increased revenue and market share. None of these companies appear to be pursuing that. The first player to nail this in the short term will likely earn a stronger following in the consumer space with repeat sales as the end-goal. It is also possible (or likely) that as the component shortage continues, those same OEMs will recognize the added value their products suddenly have earned, raising pricing in line with the rest of the market. Even Nvidia could take advantage of this shortage of graphics cards. Though its products are part of the problem for desktop buyers, in the mobile space, Nvidia has more direct control over the pricing, marketing, and partnerships that ship Nvidia graphics chips for gaming notebooks. With a dominant lead in the add-on graphics market for laptops, Nvidia should want to raise awareness of this opportunity. It gives the company a place to create long-term fans of the brand while also selling GPUs at a higher margin than is possible with the partner arrangements on desktop graphics cards. Brick-and-mortar retailers like Best Buy Costco and Wal- hould see an increased interest from PC gamers and enthusiasts hunting for the best deal on hardware. OEM PCs have a much wider distribution through those big box stores than traditional PC component vendors do, so as the savvy buyers in the market begin to branch out to pre-built systems for their hardware needs, expect to see much of that traffic to find its way into retail.

{"tick": "NVDA", "author": "Jeff Reeves", "text": "Published: Industrial automation, an aging society, self-driving cars, infrastructure and water By Investors often to pay too much attention to the short term, and overlook lasting long-term trends that ultimately matter more to their portfolio. Sure, the recent government-shutdown fight was difficult to ignore. And yes, it\u2019s hard to look away from the volatility in bitcoin. However, the best investments you can make tend rely on big-picture trends, not the latest fashionable headlines. This kind of \u201cmegatrend\u201d investing, where investors follow durable trends over many years, requires foresight and patience. But when done right, the gains can be dramatic. Best of all, investors can often tap into powerful changes in the global economy that don\u2019t rely on a broader bull market to deliver substantial profits. After all, widespread adoption of new technology or fundamental shifts in demographics don\u2019t rely on an uptick in consumer confidence or GDP. They happen because of bigger forces, and can resist typical Wall Street trends as a result. In 2018, a few such megatrends appear to be in the early stages of development. Here\u2019s how to invest in them: In the 21st century, American manufacturing jobs aren\u2019t really being stolen by low-wage workers in China. In truth, they are being taken by robots. Just look at manufacturer First Solar which is actually undercutting cheap Chinese panels with . It achieved this in part by recently laying off hundreds of workers and fully automating the fabrication process. In the words of its CEO, First Solar is \u201cnow in a better competitive position than ever.\u201d We can moralize about the loss of jobs and the rise of robots. But as investors, it may be wiser to simply embrace this megatrend and profit from it. That means investing in some of the biggest names in automation, including Rockwell Automation and Siemens AG   For those looking to play a more diversified group of stocks that include smaller and niche robotics companies, rather than just large firms, it is worth checking out the Robo Global Robotics and Automation Index ETF The fund is a good mix of about 90 stocks around the world, including midcaps and small caps. It\u2019s up about 50% in the last 12 months, too, proving the profit potential of this megatrend in manufacturing.    There\u2019s much attention paid to the graying of America, with the widely touted fact that the number of across the next four decades or so. But our nation is hardly alone, as advances in modern medicine and increased standards of living raise life expectancies around the world. In fact, nations such as Japan, Switzerland and Australia all have longer life expectancies than the U.S. right now. This trend isn\u2019t exactly a new phenomenon, as life expectancies steadily have been on the rise for years and many demographers have predicted the shift. However, with even the youngest cohort of Baby Boomers now in their mid-50s, the demographics of this key generation is reaching an important tipping point in 2018. There are many ways to play this trend via health-care stocks, but my favorite methods include a mix of tried-and-true big pharma names and up-and-coming companies researching the next generation of treatments for seniors. In the first category, I like diabetes giant Novo Nordisk  and cardiovascular and respiratory drug powerhouse Gilead As for the companies working on cures for cancer and Alzheimer\u2019s, I like a diversified basket of smaller biotechs via the SPDR S&P Biotech ETF     Another unfortunate headline for self-driving cars cropped up this week as a Tesla vehicle crashed into a firetruck on a highway in California. But on balance, the news over the last few years has been decidedly encouraging for the future of autonomous cars \u2014 and 2018 may be the year these technologies truly come into their own. Beyond the much-watched moves at Telsa, Toyota  has promised a to service Olympic spectators and athletes in 2020, and Volvo is testing self-driving work trucks for the and industries. One way to play this trend is to invest directly in the automakers you expect to succeed. However, with no ready-for-market products just yet, a safer bet may be to invest in component companies that are servicing the self-driving car industry at large. These include Swedish sensor company Autoliv Inc. digital auto components supplier Delphi Automotive and chip maker Nvidia that already has its Tegra processors in everything from Teslas to Honda Civics. There\u2019s no good ETF play on self-driving cars just yet. There are some loosely related ones like the First Trust NASDAQ Global Auto Index Fund that invests in automakers and component companies, but it is much broader than this theme. Still, you don\u2019t want to wait until 2020 to buy into this megatrend. If you wait until self-driving cars are common on the roads, you\u2019ll be too late.    While the government shutdown and spending fights may have led some to believe that nothing ever gets done in Washington, there remains a serious need for an infrastructure-spending bill In 2017, the \u2014 and you can be sure that no politician wants to preside over a downgrade to an F in 2018. Furthermore, infrastructure continues to pop up as a popular bipartisan topic both because of the need and ability to create jobs for middle-class Americans. That makes concrete and aggregate companies like Vulcan Materials and U.S. Concrete are worth a look, as are construction-materials companies like steel stock Nucor and glass and plumbing firm Masco  Beyond domestic infrastructure, there remains huge appetite for spending projects in emerging markets as nations like India and China look to growth their economies as well. That makes investments like the PowerShares Emerging Markets Infrastructure ETF interesting investments for the next several years. A twist on the megatrend of increased infrastructure spending is a focus on water and water utilities. Potable water is a basic necessity, and one that many folks take for granted. Yet after recent troubles that include the toxic water system in Flint, Mich., to persistent droughts in California, it should be obvious that water issues are a big deal \u2014 and a big investing opportunity. Many elements of America\u2019s water infrastructure are aged and beyond repair; what they need is to be wholly replaced, but cash-strapped municipalities often are not up to the task. That\u2019s where publicly traded water companies such as American Water Works Artesian Resources and York Water Company come in. These for-profit companies operate much like publicly traded electric utilities, and offer the same measure of stability \u2014 but with much more growth potential. For those who prefer ETFs, the PowerShares Water Resources ETF is a good choice. The electric-utility landscape is very mature and established after decades of consolidation. However, the emergence of for-profit water utilities is a very new occurrence and is in its early stages. Investors looking to play this megatrend will want to get in on the ground floor.

Let\u2019s find out what Fortive has to offer investors in this quarter. Fortive\u2019s diverse product portfolio and expansion into the Cloud computing segment is quite encouraging. The acquisitions of eMaint Enterprises by Fortive\u2019s subsidiary, Fluke, and the buyout of Global Traffic Technologies have allowed the company to enter into the rapidly growing cloud computing market.

{"tick": "NVDA", "author": "Nigam Arora", "text": "Published: Intel has almost moved from ugly duckling to swan By The strategy of buying \u201cugly ducklings that are just turning into swans\u201d is especially attractive for prudent investors who see high risk in chasing the momentum but still want to generate high risk-adjusted returns. One way to learn the strategy is to explore a recent buy signal on Intel .  . Note the following: \u2022As the chart shows, Intel has broken out after . \u2022 The breakout is on heavy volume. This is positive. Breakouts on heavy volume may retrace but ultimately (not always) succeed more often than not. \u2022 This is a second successive breakout. \u2022 . Such breakouts are powerful and are often followed by subsequent breakouts. This is exactly what has happened. When you look at the target zones shown on the first chart, the call to buy Intel at that time has proven spot on given that the stock has since risen more than 25%. For those interested in more depth about the last call, please see \u201c .\u201d \u2022 When the initial call was made by The Arora Report to buy Intel at an average price of $34.01, the target zone was set at $56 to $58. At that time many analysts still had a \u2018sell\u2019 on Intel and had their targets in high $30s and low $40s. This pessimism among analysts provided the opportunity for astute investors. \u2022 Now that Intel has broken out above $50, the same analysts are raising their targets to around The Arora Report\u2019s original target. The Arora Report\u2019s very long-term target now is $64 to $66. Please be aware that since Wall Street analysts have become optimistic on the stock, there is more risk in the stock now compared with our prior buy signals. The best way to understand this is that when there is a lot of pessimism, almost everyone who is going to sell has already sold it. A little bit of good news moves up the stock because there are not many sellers. On the other hand, when many become optimistic like is the case now with Intel, some of the buying power has already been exhausted. \u2022 RSI shows there is more room to run. My conclusion is Intel is a buy on retracements. Intel has almost turned into a swan from an ugly duckling when investors look at the big picture. The first step is to getting the big picture right. After Donald Trump\u2019s election, I started describing a scenario of Dow Jones Industrial Average  . The second step is to stay up to date with the big picture. The fundamental scenario I described about a year ago is still intact. Now the Dow has moved over 26,000. There is significant risk in highflying FAANG stocks such as Facebook, Amazon.com, Apple, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet. In contrast, a stock like Intel that is just turning into a swan presents a better potential for higher risk-adjusted returns.   Meltdown and Spectre are the names given to two computer processor security flaws. When they were discovered, Intel stock was aggressively sold because Wall Street didn\u2019t fully comprehend the nature of the flaws. At that time, The Arora Report call was to buy the dip and hold on to the position. A bigger point here is that investors often sell first before understanding the real implications of a news item. Investors who can decipher the real implications make money because they are able to buy at better prices when the masses are selling. Investors who bought Intel on our original call are getting a dividend of 3.53% their buy price. Investors who buy now still get a respectable 2.41% dividend. Intel trades a forward P/E of 13.25. Nvidia trades at forward P/E of 51.71 and AMD at 35.97. Of course, P/E should always be looked at relative to the growth rate. Intel is a lower-growth story, but the stock is still relatively inexpensive. The fast money has been made, though the stock still has more room to run. For those who want to control the risk and use prudence, it is important to not buy a full position after this strong breakout. It is better to scale in and control the position size. The best time to scale in is on retracements. Another technique investors can use that can over the long run double the returns is to build a core position in a stock like Intel and then add trades with tighter stops and closer targets. Investors who are enamored with Nvidia and AMD but have ignored Intel may want to take a second look at the stock, especially on retracements.

{"tick": "NVDA", "author": "Wallace Witkowski", "text": "Published: Stock has wiped away 2017 losses in less than a month amid speculation that Ethereum mining led to GPU sales By When Advanced Micro Devices Inc. reports earnings Tuesday, the results will hold clues about how cryptocurrency mining effected graphics-chip sales, and the forecast will give indications about the effects of flaws in AMD\u2019s other core products. AMD shares this year have been making up some ground lost from 2017, when rival chip-maker shares skyrocketed. Gains may have been muted, though, by the January disclosure of chip design flaws \u2014 Spectre and Meltdown \u2014 that shook the industry as a whole. When news of the exploits first broke, AMD , but has admitted that to the flaw.   Shares were volatile following reports that a  software patch to address the vulnerabilities , so AMD will likely provide more detail about its efforts, as larger rival  did Thursday. Intel proved that there is life after Spectre (and patch problems), after showing off results from the quarter just before the vulnerabilities were revealed.   Meltdown and Spectre will not have an effect on the actual results that AMD reports Tuesday, but cryptocurrency mining likely will. Analysts suggested the popularity of mining for ether, the , drove sales of graphics chips from AMD and Nvidia Corp.  in the fourth quarter. As cryptocurrency mining moves from hobbyist rigs to enterprise-level operations, some question as mining systems move toward a more software-based approach. AMD will factor any doubts about future crypto-mining sales into its forecast, along with concerns about the Spectre battle.    The 21 analysts surveyed by FactSet on average expect AMD to post adjusted earnings of 5 cents a share, up from 4 cents a share expected at the beginning of the quarter. Estimize, a software platform that uses crowdsourcing from hedge-fund executives, brokerages, buy-side analysts and others, calls for adjusted earnings of 7 cents a share.  Wall Street expects revenue of $1.41 billion, according to 21 analysts polled by FactSet. That\u2019s up from the $1.33 billion forecast at the beginning of the quarter. AMD predicted revenue of $1.35 billion to $1.45 billion, and Estimize expects revenue of $1.45 billion.  AMD shares are traditionally volatile after earnings. In fact, in the September-ending quarter. Shares rose 2.3% to $13.25 Monday and are up 30% for the year, following a 9.3% decline in 2017. In comparison, the PHLX Semiconductor Index is up 10% this year, and gained 38% in 2017, while the S&P 500 index is up 6.7% this year after a 2017 gain of about 20%.    Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh, who has a buy rating and a $17 price target on AMD, said strong stands to benefit AMD as well as Nvidia. \u201cWe believe it is key to understand that pricing reflects more of a stronger GPU demand and tight GPU inventory than a pricing tailwind,\u201d Rakesh said in a note. A lot of that is attributed to the ether effect, and Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland said that could be a problem because a lot of those sales are at a significant markup and may be artificially inflating revenue.   In a note, Rolland said \u201cwe believe a scenario exists whereby GPU sales are artificially inflated as consumers buy premium gaming cards and use them for gaming 5% of the time and mining the other 95% to recoup as much of the upfront cost as possible.\u201d Rolland said that after about nine months, those cards will hold significant \u201csalvage value\u201d for resale into the used market, which could depress prices in the future. On Monday, MKM Partners analyst Ruben Roy, who has a neutral rating, from $13 and expects AMD to top Wall Street estimates and offer a strong forecast for the March-ending quarter. Of the 28 analysts who cover AMD, nine have buy or overweight ratings, 15 have hold ratings and four have sell ratings, with an average price target of $14.23, a 7.5% premium to recent trading.

{"tick": "NVDA", "author": "Wallace Witkowski", "text": "Published: Strong outlook gets boost from new accounting standard By Advanced Micro Devices Inc. shares rallied Wednesday after the chip maker showed strong growth in its computer and graphics business with a significant amount of that estimated to come from cryptocurrency-mining-related sales, but some analysts are still taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the company\u2019s turnaround. AMD shares were after the chip maker reported better-than-expected results, dropping at first up to 5% after hours before swinging to a gain, and stood as the most actively traded stock in Tuesday after-hours trading. On Wednesday, shares surged 6.7% to $13.72 for a gain of nearly 33% for January alone. In comparison, the PHLX Semiconductor Index is up 8.3% and the S&P 500 index is up 5.4% this month. Of note, revenue from computer and graphics products, which includes desktop and laptop chips as well as graphics chips, surged 60% to $958 million from the year-ago quarter. That\u2019s the segment which includes products used for cryptocurrency mining. That strength also translated into share gains for rival Nvidia Corp. , which saw its stock rise 1.6% on Wednesday.    Analyst notes from late Tuesday and Wednesday focused primarily on those estimated crypto sales; AMD\u2019s outlook, which utilized new accounting standards; and gross margins. Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis, who has a buy rating and a $19 price target, noted that one-third of AMD\u2019s $140 million in quarter-to-quarter growth in computer and graphic revenue was due to cryptocurrency-mining demand, and that the other two-thirds was for gaming and desktop uses \u201cvalidating the strength of new product cycles.\u201d \u201cWe model AMD server share at 5% and 10% share exiting 2018 and 2019, and continue to view blockchain and cryptocurrency as longer-term growth drivers,\u201d Lipacis said. Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh, who has a buy rating and a $17 price target, said while attention is being paid to computer and graphics growth, investors are also concerned about traction in the company\u2019s sales to data centers and gross margin improvement. MKM Partners analyst Ruben Roy, who has a neutral rating and a $14.50 \u201cfair value estimate,\u201d adopted a more-wait and see attitude toward new product rollouts. Roy noted \u201cwhile we continue to appreciate AMD\u2019s execution, we still see the shares as appropriately valued at current levels until more clarity on the sustainability of new product growth can be attained.\u201d Susquehanna Financial analyst Christopher Rolland, who has a neutral rating and $13 price target, took issue with AMD\u2019s unexpected use of accounting standard ASC 606, which concerns reporting revenue from contracts. Rolland noted: While we believe 1Q18 guidance was likely a massive beat, also driven in large part by crypto-related GPU shipments after a record January, the company announced (without warning) the adoption of the ASC 606 accounting change, but refused to quantify the impact (this is not common practice as all our covered companies have quantified the impact), thus obscuring 1Q18 guidance. AMD had forecast first-quarter revenue of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, well above the then-Street consensus of $1.25 billion, which got a $100 million boost from the application of ASC 606. Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer, who has a perform rating on AMD, noted concern about the company\u2019s gross margin growth even with the introduction of new products. AMD reported a fourth-quarter gross margin of 35%, up from 32% in the year-ago quarter, but flat sequentially. Schafer noted: Consensus estimates called for ~13% FY18 revenue growth into the print, and margin leverage appears limited despite new products (Ryzen/Vega/EPYC) accounting for a larger share of revenue. Net, while commentary around new products (33% of 4Q revenue) appears positive, we believe the FY18 guidance serves as a reminder that AMD\u2019s turnaround remains early days. Stifel analyst Kevin Cassidy, who has a hold rating and a $13 target price, also was adopting a wait-and-see approach to margin expansion. He noted: Management\u2019s full year 2018 guidance for double digit revenue growth, greater than 36% GM and OpEx at ~28% of revenue is also above our prior estimates. AMD\u2019s revenue performance may be catching up to its share price valuation but we are waiting for evidence of significant GM expansion to justify the earnings valuation. Of the 28 analysts who cover AMD, nine have buy or overweight ratings, 15 have hold ratings and four have sell ratings. Before the report, analysts had an average price target of $14.23. After earnings, that rose to an average price target of $14.56. Wallace Witkowski is a MarketWatch news editor in San Francisco. Follow him on Twitter @wmwitkowski.

Zacks Equity Research      Keeping its positive surprise history alive, (   )\t, yesterday, reported solid results for fourth-quarter 2017, marking the eighth consecutive quarter of better-than-expected performance for both, the top as well as the bottom line. Also, revenues and earnings came in ahead of the company\u2019s guidance ranges. Apart from this, Proofpoint witnessed significant year-over-year improvement in revenues and earnings. However, the company\u2019s outlook for the current quarter and full-year 2018 is somewhat disappointing as its revenues and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance ranges at the mid-point are pegged below analysts\u2019 estimates. This made investors a little cautious over Proofpoint\u2019s long-term prospects, resulting in a plunge of approximately 2.4% in the company\u2019s shares price during after-hour trade. Nonetheless, the company has outperformed the to which it belongs to over the past year. The stock has rallied 26.1% in the said period, while the industry registered 7.9% growth. Let\u2019s now discuss quarter results in detail. Proofpoint reported total revenues of $145.4 million, up 36.1% year over year, mainly driven by customer additions, improved add-on-sales and strong renewal rate. The company\u2019s revenues also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $140 million as well as came in ahead of the guidance range of $138-$140 million. Total billings during the quarter also jumped 36% year over year to $188.6 million. Also, renewal rates remained well more than 90% during the reported quarter. Non-GAAP gross profit advanced 37.1% from the year-ago quarter to $112.9 million. Moreover, non-GAAP gross margin expanded 50 basis points (bps) to 77.6%, primarily driven by higher sales and efficiency improvements across the company\u2019s cloud operations. Total non-GAAP operating expenses flared up 32.9% year over year to $96.2 million mainly due to increased spending on hiring sales personnel. However, as a percentage of revenues, it decreased to 66.2% from 67.8% in the year-ago quarter. Proofpoint\u2019s non-GAAP operating income for the quarter increased to $16.6 million from $9.9 million reported in the year-ago quarter. In addition, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 11.4%, mainly benefiting from higher revenues, improved gross margin and decreased operating expenses as a percentage of sales. Non-GAAP net income increased to $16.4 million from $9.6 million reported in the prior-year quarter. It also came in ahead of the company\u2019s guidance of $9.5-$10.5 million. On a per share basis, the company reported non-GAAP earnings of 29 cents, marking an impressive year-over-year jump of 61%. Quarterly earnings also came in ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 21 cents as well as the company\u2019s guidance range of 19-21 cents per share. | Proofpoint exited the quarter with cash and cash equivalents, and short-term investments of approximately $331.6 million, up from the previous-quarter balance of $459.6 million. Accounts receivable were $109.3 million compared with $91.5 million reported at the end of third-quarter 2017. During 2017, the company generated operating cash flow of $153.7 million. Free cash flow for the year came in at $106.7 million. Despite a stellar fourth-quarter performance, Proofpoint\u2019s guidance for first-quarter and full-year 2018 is not so encouraging. For 2018, the company raised its outlook for revenues but lowered the same for non-GAAP earnings. Proofpoint now expects revenues in the range of $660-$665 million (mid-point $662.5 million), up from $644-$648 million (mid-point $646 million) predicted earlier. However, guidance range at the mid-point is below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $663.5 million. Billings expectations has also been raised to $828-$833 million from $798-$802 million projected earlier. Non-GAAP earnings per share are now anticipated in the band of 95 cents to $1.02 (mid-point 98.5 cents), down from the previous guidance range of 96 cents to $1.03 (mid-point 99.5 cents). Earnings expectation at the mid-point is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are estimated to be 71% and 77%, respectively. Non-GAAP net income is projected in the range of $52-$56 million. Free cash flow for the year is expected in the range of $138-$140 million, while capital expenditure will likely be approximately $45 million. Coming to the first-quarter outlook, the company anticipates reporting revenues in the range of $138-140 million, and billings between $149 million and $151 million. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at approximately $147 million. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are estimated to be 70% and 76%, respectively. Non-GAAP net income is projected in the range of $8-$9 million, or 15-17 cents per share. Currently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at 18 cents. Free cash flow is projected in the range of $22-$24 million, while capital expenditure will likely be approximately $10 million during the first quarter. Proofpoint is a leading security-as-a-service provider that focuses on cloud-based solutions for threat protection, compliance, archiving & governance, and secure communications. The company\u2019s continued focus on launching products, acquisitions and partnerships have helped it register more than 35% revenue growth consistently for the last eight quarters. However, a pessimistic outlook for the first quarter and full year makes us slightly cautious about its near-term prospects. Additionally, since it continues to invest in sales and marketing, we anticipate this to remain a drag on the company\u2019s bottom line in the near term. Intensifying competition and an uncertain macroeconomic environment add to its woes. Currently, Proofpoint carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA (   )\t, Intel (   )\t and Texas Instruments (   )\t, all carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see . Long-term expected EPS growth rates for NVIDIA, Intel and Texas Instruments are 10.3%, 8.4% and 9.6%, respectively.

Zacks Equity Research      (   )\t reported third-quarter fiscal 2018 non-GAAP earnings of $1.36 per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. The figure improved 29.5% year over year but declined 3.5% sequentially. The year-over-year upside was driven by higher net sales, which increased 12.8% from the year-ago quarter to $994.2 million. However, the same declined 1.8% sequentially. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $992 million. Book-to-bill ratio was approximately 1.00 compared with 1.05 in the previous quarter, reflecting stable lead times. Management expects to achieve normal lead times by June 2018. Shares of the company were up more than 2%, yesterday. The stock returned 24.6% year over year, substantially outperforming the \u2019s rally of 17.5%.  In terms of product line, microcontroller business (66.5% of net sales) increased 18.9% year over driven by robust demand for 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. Microchip unveiled a single-wire, Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory (EEPROM) device, which will help in remote identification of electronic components. The company also launched Crypto Authentication device, which will allow developers to integrate hardware-based security to their designs. Additionally, it announced a third-party security design partner program. In the quarter, Microchip announced that it has improved response time for critical system events to help designers create CAN-based applications, without any added complexity. Additionally, the company expanded collaboration with Amazon Web services (AWS) to support AWS offerings as well as develop secure cloud systems. However, analog sales (23.3% of net sales) were down 3.2% on a sequential basis. Revenues were hurt by capacity constraint at Atmel. Moreover, the company\u2019s intent to offer total system solutions that combines microcontroller cores with analog products and connectivity firmware negatively impacted sales. Revenue recognition for these products was shifted from analog business to the microcontroller business. Still management believes that the higher margin total system solutions will help Microchip retain customers and win new designs in the long haul. According to the company, improving capacity constraints along with design wins will enable the analog business to expand at a higher rate than Microchip. Memory sales (4.8% of net sales) were down 7.6% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Licensing (2.8% of net sales) sales increased 6.8% sequentially and 15.5% on a year-over-year basis. In the reported quarter, MMO revenues came in at $26 million and accounted for 2.6% of net sales. Geographically, Asia remained Microchip\u2019s largest market with 60% of net sales coming from the region. Europe and Americas contributed 23% and 17%, respectively. Microchip posted non-GAAP gross margin of 61.4%, which expanded 360 bps on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of revenues, were down 300 bps year over year and 50 bps sequentially to 22%. The decline was primarily due to lower research & development (R&D) expenses and selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses, which decreased 170 bps and 130 bps, respectively. As a result, non-GAAP operating margin expanded 660 bps from the year-ago quarter and 80 bps sequentially to 39.4%. Cash generated in the reported quarter was $365 million compared with $350.1 million in the previous quarter. As of Dec 31, 2017, cash and total investment position was $1.985 billion compared with $1.84 billion in the previous quarter. Management noted that inventory on Dec 31, 2017, was at 115 days, up by 10 days from the September quarter level. The company declared a quarterly cash dividend of 36.30 cents per share, which is payable on Mar 6, 2018. Microchip forecasts fourth-quarter fiscal 2018 net sales in the range of $964.4-$1,004.1 million. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.01 billion. Non-GAAP gross margin is anticipated in the range of 61.3-61.7%, which is based on Microchip 2.0 margin drivers. Non-GAAP operating expenses, as percentage of sales, are projected in the 22-22.4% band and operating margin is expected at 38.9-39.7%. For the fourth quarter, earnings are anticipated in the range of $1.30-$1.39 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $1.38. Microchip's inventory days in the impending quarter is expected to between 115 and 120 days. Capital expenditures are estimated in the range of $50-$60 million. For fiscal 2018, capital expenditures are now projected in the range of $200-$210 million, down from $200-$220 million guided previously.\u00a0 This reflects aggressive investment to strengthen and expand production capabilities. Furthermore, the company plans to bring in-house more of the assembly and test operations that are currently outsourced, which will ultimately improve gross margin. The heightened capital expenditures also reflect three new buildings that Microchip is constructing in Arizona, India and Germany. These, in turn, will help in reducing cost in the long-haul. Microchip carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). NVIDIA Corporation (   )\t, Intel Corporation (   )\t and Facebook, Inc. (   )\t are some better-ranked stocks in the technology sector. All the three companies hold a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see NVIDIA, Intel and Facebookhave a long-term earnings growth rate of 10.3%, 8.4% and 26.7%, respectively.

This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +25% per year. These returns cover a period from 1988-2016 and were examined and attested by Baker Tilly Virchow Krause, LLP, an independent accounting firm. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zack Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.

{"tick": "NVDA", "author": "Anora M. Gaudiano", "text": "Published: Blockchain ETFs have significant overlap in top holdings By Cryptocurrency markets might be cooling off, but the hype around blockchain isn\u2019t abating, judging by the popularity of exchange-traded funds centered on the technology. Four new ETFs, all promising to give investors exposure to blockchain technology, launched in January. The latest is the Innovation Shares NextGen Protocol ETF, which trades under the ticker KOIN and made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The newcomer said it aims to stand out thanks to a stock-picking methodology driven by an artificial-intelligence algorithm, though its methodology is similar to two competitors, which also use a combination of machines and humans to read news and regulatory filings to screen stocks. Such ETFs are seeing a surge in interest that appears driven by hype surrounding blockchain, the distributed ledger technology that underpins digital currency like bitcoin, according to Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence.    \u201cThese ETF issuers are tapping into the mania surrounding bitcoin and blockchain and are cashing in by launching products that investors want,\u201d Balchunas said. The four recently launched products are similar to each other, with an overlap in their top holdings. They also overlap with existing sector ETFs such as the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund  \u201cIf someone wants a pure blockchain exposure, they can\u2019t get it because there are not enough stocks to put into an ETF,\u201d Balchunas said. Instead, these ETFs give you the \u201cstory of a blockchain,\u201d but in reality perform like the broader market, he said. Matthew Markiewicz, head of Innovation Shares, said that while a lot of technology companies overlap, \u201cover time our AI algorithm will pick new companies that provide tools for or use blockchain technology.\u201d KOIN is competing against three other ETFs that listed a few weeks earlier. The Amplify Transformational Data Sharing ETF was launched on Jan. 17 and to date it is the largest with $185 million under management. According to the description of the ETF, \u201cit provides access to an actively managed basket of global companies at the forefront of blockchain-based technology.\u201d The second largest is the Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF launched on the same day as BLOK, which also invests in blockchain-related companies. \u201cBLOK and BLCN together raised $100 million in just three days. That shows you how much demand there is for these instruments,\u201d Balchunas said. The two latest entrants\u2014LEGR or First Trust Indxx Innovative Transaction & Process ETF, and KOIN had the disadvantage of launching a week or two later. LEGR, which was launched on Jan 24, has attracted about $10 million in assets, while KOIN, has only $2.5 million. All four ETFs share the same companies in their top holdings: Microsoft Inc. Overstock.com Inc. Square Intel Corp. NVIDIA Corp IBM and Oracle Corp  Unlike existing technology funds, blockchain ETFs charge substantially higher fees. The Amplify fund is actively managed and charges 70 basis points. But the others passively track indexes and still charge between 65-70 basis points. For comparison, XLK\u2019s expense ratio is 0.13%, or 13 basis points, though popular thematic ETFs such as MJX or GAMR charge about 70 basis points. But ultimately, blockchain funds are able to charge hefty fees because investors are willing to pay for convenience and exposure to the hot industry. \u201cInvestors are willing to pay the fee for a product when it has a value-added component to it. In our case, we provide a strategy that capitalizes on a growing technological innovation,\u201d said Ryan Issakainen, exchange-traded fund strategist at First Trust Portfolios. Eric Ervin, chief executive officer at Reality Shares, said higher fees are due to costs associated with the index provider. \u201cThe index we are tracking is rather expensive but that is because a lot of thought goes into selecting companies that are truly innovating and developing blockchain technology that will eventually benefit every company,\u201d Ervin said. Michael Venuto, co-founder at Toroso Investments, which serves as the subadviser of BLOK, which is actively managed, said the fee is a lot less than what a typical actively managed fund charges. \u201cWe truly think that managing a portfolio that is focused on an industry that is changing so rapidly is a huge advantage.\u201d As to hype, Venuto does not disagree that there is a mad rush to cryptocurrencies, but suggests it is better to invest in companies that are \u201cacting like shovel sellers during a gold rush than trying to mine the gold.\u201d Cryptocurrencies soared in 2017, with the largest, bitcoin rising from less than $1,000 in December 2016 to an all-time high just shy of $20,000 in December. Since then, digital coins have plunged, with bitcoin below $9,000. On Thursday, BLOK fell 1.6%, while BLCN lost 1%. LEGR declined 0.4% and KOIN declined 1%. Blockchain ETFs have been able to charge high fees because investor demand showed they could. And the flows into these products have been unprecedented, according to Balchunas. \u201cIn fact, among the independently issued ETFs, MJX \u2014a marijuana ETF and BLOK were the fastest-growing,\u201d Balchunas said. Balchunas said that money flowing into these ETFs is primarily from retail investors, with much of the demand coming from overseas. \u201cInstitutional investors do not have to pay 70 basis points for an ETF when they can ask their asset manager to build a portfolio based on the same basket for 1-2 basis points. But retail investors love the convenience of buying and selling with one click in the brokerage accounts,\u201d he said. \u201cAnecdotally, it appears that a lot of flows come from financial advisers and individual brokerage accounts with a fair chunk coming from foreign buyers,\u201d said Ervin at Reality Shares. \u201cAs a former financial adviser, I would say it is a much safer way to play and get exposure than investing in cryptocurrencies.\u201d Anora M.

{"tick": "NVDA", "author": "Nigam Arora", "text": "Published: Facebook is the top-ranked stock By Earnings on many popular tech stocks, including the FAANGs, are out. For the most part, earnings are better than the consensus numbers but worse than the whisper numbers. Moreover, tech stocks have had a good run. How much of the good news is already discounted in the prices? Should you buy or sell? A helpful technique is to look at segmented money flows. Please for a chart showing money flows in popular tech stocks. It shows money flows in FAANG stocks of Facebook , Apple Amazon Netflix and Alphabet   It also shows money flows in popular tech stocks of AMD Alibaba Microsoft Nvidia and Tesla  Note the following: \u2022 The \u201csmart money flows\u201d are positive only for Facebook and Alibaba. \u2022 Those flows are negative for AMD, Nvidia and Tesla. \u2022 They are neutral for Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. \u2022 The momo (momentum) crowd is aggressively buying tech stocks. \u2022 Short squeezes are adding to the buying. In a short squeeze, short sellers panic and buy to cover to cut their losses. This adds fuel to the fire. The same chart shows relative rank of the five FAANG stocks. The ranks are determined by the , which takes into account not only probability-adjusted rewards but also probability-adjusted risks. Facebook is ranked No. 1, and Netflix is fifth. Most investors can benefit from some of the sophisticated techniques that smart money uses. The smart money puts lots of emphasis on risk and takes a portfolio approach. With the run in tech stocks, these have become outsize positions in many portfolios. From a risk perspective, it doesn\u2019t make sense to add to positions that are already disproportionately large. Instead, it makes sense to trim into strength. Investors can often double their returns by using a simple technique: building a core position and holding it for a very long time, then trading around the core position with positions that have a shorter time horizon, closer stops and closer targets. In some ways, these trade-around positions are similar to swing trading. As an example, look at Intel At The Arora Report, Intel was bought at an average price of $34.01 for the long term. Please for the annotated chart of Intel; for each successive buy signal shown on the chart, a trade-around position has been started.

A simple antidote is to not make the two mistakes that many investors are making now. Please see \u201c \u201d and \u201c .\u201d    Investors ought to consider following the smart money as market conditions are beginning to change. have turned negative; only the leading economic indicators category is still positive. Most worrisome are valuation vs. competition, and sentiment. Bonds are now offering stronger competition to stocks because of rising interest rates. Sentiment is a contrary indicator when it becomes extremely positive. The smart money is buying Facebook; it makes sense to buy Facebook on pullbacks in the buy zone.    Those not in tech stocks may consider waiting for dips in the buy zones to initiate positions. Buy zones are dynamic and change based on market conditions. They are designed for a 70% probability of a fill over the next 120 days. The point is to buy as low as possible. Those in these positions may consider continuing to hold but review to make sure they have not become disproportionately large in the context of a total portfolio. If they have become disproportionately large, it is better to start scaling out in small tranches into strength as opposed to panicking and selling into weakness. It is important to hold on to core positions. These stocks do have considerable upside potential, perhaps after a pull back. Those in positions that are properly sized may consider starting new trade-around positions when signals are given.

{"tick": "NVDA", "author": "Philip van Doorn", "text": "Published: All but two S&P 500 companies declined By Investors got a rude awakening Monday. U.S. stocks started the day with declines. And then an acceleration occurred late in the trading day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average eventually closing down 1,175 points, or 4.6%, at 24,346. The S&P 500 Index tumbled 4.1% to 2,649. For perspective, it has been only two months (Dec. 8) since the Dow closed at a lower level than it did Monday. Look at this chart: Despite the 1,000-plus drop in the Dow, it wasn\u2019t the worst day for the index. That honor goes to Oct. 19, 1987, so-called Black Monday, when it plunged 22.6%. Here\u2019s a summary showing Dow and S&P 500 price changes, with the S&P 500 sectors sorted by how much they fell Monday: The Dow is now down 1.5% for 2018, but that follows a gain of 25.1% in 2017. The S&P 500 is now down 0.9% this year, following last year\u2019s 19.4% advance. None of the figures in this article include dividends, by the way. More perspective \u2014 the three-year chart for the S&P 500 features two major temporary pullbacks for the benchmark index in 2015: From Aug. 17 through Aug. 25, 2015, the benchmark index declined 11%, before recovering and then rising to a new closing high on Nov. 3 of that year. From that high, it bounced around and then decreased 13% through Feb. 12, 2016, before resuming a long upward climb. From Jan. 26, 2018, until Monday, the decline totaled 8%. The worst sector on Monday was financials, down 5%. It has fallen 0.2% in 2018, following a 20% gain in 2017. Health care was the second-worst sector Monday, with a 4.6% drop. It\u2019s still up 0.4% for 2018, extending last year\u2019s 20% increase. This pattern doesn\u2019t hold for all the sectors, but it sure does for the broad indices. All 30 components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell Monday: There are actually 505 stocks in the S&P 500, because several companies have two classes of common shares in the index. Monday\u2019s decline was incredibly broad \u2014 all but two S&P 500 stocks were down. Shares of Church & Dwight Co. rose 2.4% to close at $47.42, while TripAdvisor Inc. was up 3.7% to close at $35.62.

The U.S. stock market\u2019s on Monday was extremely broad based, with every major S&P 500 sector falling at least 1% and most dropping more than 3%. However, the day\u2019s weakness was concentrated in some of the names that had recently been among Wall Street\u2019s biggest stand outs, and the trend of market leaders leading the way lower may just be getting started. Market breadth, or the ratio of advancing stocks to declining ones over a given period, has , who note that a few key names\u2014notably the FAANG group of large-capitalization internet and technology stocks\u2014have accounted for of the overall market\u2019s advance. These names, due to their outsize gains over the past months, could now be especially vulnerable to downside pressure, and because some of the market\u2019s largest names are included among the gainers\u2014meaning they have some of the largest weights in indexes like the S&P 500 , which are constructed around the market capitalization of their components\u2014any additional declines could be acutely felt. Cirrus Research, in a note titled \u201cLeadership stocks at risk as markets become too narrow,\u201d highlighted this concern.

Outside of \u2019s graphics and gaming sales, data-center and auto-related sales are the fastest growing arms of the Santa Clara, Calif.-based chip maker. Gaming revenue is expected to rise 14% to $1.54 billion from the year-ago period, according to FactSet, but data-center revenue is expected to jump 85% to $548.1 million. Auto-related revenue, which was the , is forecast to rise 19% to $152.2 million. Recently, Nvidia to develop self-driving vehicle systems, and with , while the company\u2019s opportunities in the auto market. In those systems, however, that can be exploited by hackers. Also, data visualization revenue is estimated to rise 7% to $240.9 million, and PC and mobile OEM revenue is expected to decline 3.4% to $170.1 million. A focus on cryptocurrency mining-based sales will likely be acute given that a third of \u2019s computer and graphics chip revenue was estimated to come from . Investors, however, may start rethinking how relevant cryptocurrency mining is to both Nvidia and AMD given the recent selloffs in digital currencies. Bitcoin prices rallied more than 200% over the December ending quarter to end the year just shy of $14,000, after nearly reaching $20,000, but are now trading around $7,000.  Of the 23 analysts surveyed by FactSet, Nvidia on average is expected to post adjusted earnings of $1.16 a share, up from the 98 cents a share expected at the beginning of the quarter, and from 99 cents a share a year ago. Estimize, a software platform that uses crowdsourcing from hedge-fund executives, brokerages, buy-side analysts and others, calls for earnings of $1.27 a share.  Wall Street expects revenue of $2.66 billion from Nvidia, according to 26 analysts polled by FactSet. That\u2019s up from the $2.44 billion forecast at the beginning of the quarter, and from $2.17 billion recorded last year. Nvidia predicted revenue of $2.6 billion to $2.7 billion.

He noted: While the company guided revenue to be flat sequentially, we think Gaming and Data Center will help drive total company revenue growth +5-6% sequentially. We think this will be enough to hold the stock flat/up on the print and in order for the Company to see material upside, Data Center would need to grow more than double digits on a sequential basis (beating bullish buyside expectations). Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh, who has a buy rating and recently raised his price target to $240 from $225, had this to say: We believe NVDA remains well-positioned in Data Center with Deep learning and new inferencing platforms such as TensorRT with V100 (delivering 100x performance of a CPU DC, and with parallel processing GPUs not affected by Meltdown/Spectre issues) though price points remain high. NVDA also announced Automotive wins at Baidu, Uber and ZF with new Xavier and Drive PX Pegasus platforms for Level 5. Jefferies analyst Mark Lipacis, who has a buy rating and a $240 price target, said Nvidia is one of his top picks in 2018 as the \u201cconsumption of semis is actually accelerating for the first time in a while, driven by cyclical demand drivers in Industrial, and secular demand drivers in parallel processing and IoT.\u201d Of the 33 analysts who cover Nvidia, 15 have buy or overweight ratings, 15 have hold ratings and three have sell or underweight ratings, with an average price target of $218.21, or about 1% lower than Tuesday\u2019s trade.
