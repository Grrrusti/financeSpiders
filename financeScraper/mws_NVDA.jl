{"link": "https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2017-11-22/bitcoin-leaves-the-tech-giants-trailing", "text": "Bitcoin pushed beyond $8,000 this week, a boon to those willing to pour money into a risky and speculative piece of code that's hoarded more than spent. But the crypto craze is leaving behind the very technology companies that were meant to benefit without having to touch the stuff. Despite all the evangelizing about the blockchain's decentralized nature, the days of a global network of laptop-toting techies mining Bitcoin from home\u00a0or the coffee shop appear to be over. They've been usurped by specialist firms\u00a0with the resources to make their own powerful mining kit. This isn't great news for big listed chipmakers such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.\u00a0and NVIDIA Corp., whose graphics cards have been used to do the power-sucking computations needed to confirm transactions. These cards are\u00a0made to handle sophisticated gaming graphics so they're very good at repetitive data crunching. Still, they haven't kept pace as Bitcoin's\u00a0supply cap puts ever greater computing demands on each new transaction confirmation. AMD and NVIDIA shares have done better than their peers in recent years, in part because of their usefulness to the crypto crowd, but their stock\u00a0didn\u2019t react much to the latest Bitcoin highs. For Bitcoin at least, it seems the only way for an equipment supplier to make money is to be involved in the whole chain: that is, make the mining gear, use it yourself and sell it to others, and trade the coins too. It's hard to imagine a $100 billion-plus listed company getting that past investors. Take the world's biggest Bitcoin mining collective, Bitmain, which runs 25,000 custom-built machines in Inner Mongolia just to make about $250,000 in daily revenue, or $91 million annually. Why would a big chipmaker compete head-on here? At $6 billion globally, Bitcoin mining revenues aren't worth the bet yet. Bitcoin rival Ethereum is a slightly different story, and has buoyed sales recently at AMD and NVIDIA. Its algorithm is different to Bitcoin's and works better for miners wielding the kind of graphics cards, called GPUs, sold by the listed chipmakers than for those with specialized chipsets. Its price spike in May gave miners the chance to lock in profits quicker, and GPUs flew off the shelves. Still, that\u00a0demand surge might not last. The economics of Ethereum mining are getting harder, like Bitcoin's. And its developers are mulling a radical overhaul, which would make mining less about who has the most powerful processor and more about who has the biggest pile of existing tokens. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that AMD's GPU revenue will fall to $1.2 billion next year from an estimated $1.5 billion in 2017, as Ethereum-linked sales tail off. The bubble may deflate. With AMD trading at\u00a0100 times this year's earnings, according to Bloomberg data, and NVIDIA at about 50 times, any\u00a0tail off in crypto demand might hurt. Some of the inflation in the shares is to do with heightened expectations around eSports and data centers too, but it's\u00a0tough to square the giddy valuations with future growth. Peer NXP trades at 18 times and is more exposed to the well-established but technically promising autos sector. Investors looking for stock-market exposure to\u00a0crypto will probably need to use\u00a0more direct options such as Riot Blockchain Inc., a tiny digital currency company, or even Square Inc., which is . For the chipmakers, there's still a hope that\u00a0crypto's complex rules could be altered for the better. One new Bitcoin spin-off, \"Bitcoin Gold,\" wants to be an algorithm that will benefit bedroom miners over the Bitmains of the world. But the higher Bitcoin goes, the stronger its \"no change\" defenders become.

Higher wages are raising the specter of inflation. As a result, interest rates have risen rapidly as investors and traders anticipate that the era of benign inflation may be coming to an end. Does it make sense to wait until the next inflation-related data point is released before making big buy or sell decisions in the markets? If yes, please read on. The Morning Capsule that is made available to the subscribers to The Arora Report every day before the market open said: \u201cFrom a fundamental perspective, the reason for the downdraft is the specter of inflation. On Wednesday morning at 8:30 a.m. ET, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) will be released. The smart money appears to be waiting for this data before acting.\u201d So the all-important inflation report coincides with Valentine\u2019s Day this year. May both events be favorable to investors ... Let\u2019s examine inflation using a chart.      Please click to see the chart of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) excluding food and energy prices. Please note the following from the chart: \u2022 The specter of deflation is over. \u2022 CPI ex-food and energy can vary quite a bit from month to month. \u2022 The Federal Reserve has been targeting 2% inflation. The data so far are not out of line.    The consensus is for CPI to come in at 0.4%. Expect machine-driven investing strategies to buy stocks if that number is lower and sell if the number is higher. However, most investors should not react to what machines may do when the news hits. At The Arora Report we look at CPI ex-food and energy; our estimate is 0.2%. Yes, we all consume food and energy. The reason for excluding food and energy is that food and energy are volatile. The volatility makes it impossible to use the data for any kind of prediction. To see the 10 categories of inputs that go into The Arora Report timing model, please click . The ZYX Global Allocation Model is adaptive, i.e., it changes automatically with market conditions.     On Friday, when the market was down 700 points, the \u201cmomo\u201d (momentum) crowd was aggressively selling but the \u201csmart money\u201d (professionals) was buying into the weakness. This morning the momo crowd is aggressively buying. The smart money is inactive. On the dip, the smart money was lightly buying Facebook Alibaba Twitter Snap Bank of America and Citigroup  The momo crowd is getting whipsawed and mostly focused on Amazon Apple Nvidia Micron and AMD  Among ETFs, the smart money seems to be focusing on S&P 500 ETF Bank ETF regional bank ETF and emerging markets ETF  The momo crowd seems to be focused on the Nasdaq 100 ETF semiconductor ETF and biotech ETFs and    The message here is to wait until the CPI data are known. At The Arora Report, we will be digging into the various components that form the inflation index. Furthermore, we will be depending on our algorithms to see how the smart money reacts to the data.

The analysts of the report have identified NVIDIA Corporation and INTEL Corporation as the top two companies who were ahead of the curve in 2016, whereas Google Inc., Qualcomm Incorporated, IBM Corporation, CEVA Inc., Xilinx, Graphcore, Teradeep Inc., and Advanced Micro Devices are some of the other notable companies currently harnessing the prospects of deep learning.   Since the entry barriers of this market are not incredibly high and heavily dependent on technologies that are not patented, startups have a strong chance to make a mark. In the near future, the shares in the global deep learning chipset are expected to head towards a fragmented scenario, although most of the prominent chip manufacturers are anticipated to hold onto their position of strength. Market leaders are expected to frequently indulge into acquisition and collaboration activities with startups with niche concepts. For instance, in January 2016, Google Inc. agreed to collaborate with Movidius to enhance its deep learning portfolio on mobile devices, which was later acquired by Intel Corporation. Later in August the same year, Intel Corporation also acquired Nervana Systems in order to further solidify its position in developing the hardware chipsets platform.     If the projections of the TMR report are to be believed, the demand in the global deep learning chipset market will increment at a phenomenal CAGR of 24.7% during the forecast period of 2017 to 2025. The report has estimated that from its calculated worth of merely US$150.17 mn in 2015, the opportunities in the global deep learning market will translate into a revenue of US$1,264.78 mn by the end of 2025. Based on type, the TMR report segments the global deep learning chipset market into application specific integrated circuits (ASICs), central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), and others. Compute capacity bifurcation of the market has been done into low (less than 1 TFlops) and high (greater than 1 TFlops). End-user classification of the market has been done into automotive, consumer electronics, healthcare, industrial, aerospace and defense, and others. Geographically, the analysts have detected that although North America currently provides for the maximum chunk of demand, the region of Asia Pacific will overtake in terms of demand and revenue by the end of 2025.      The global deep learning chipset market is primarily driven by significant improvements in the chip algorithms in the last few year, which has enormously increased their ability to consume and manage data efficiently. With increasing adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) that promises to connect billions of new devices and pertaining data streams, it is very likely that much more digital data will be generated and consequently, the industry of machine learning and deep learning will flourish. Moreover, newly build algorithms are shifting the learning from one particular application to another application, making it easily possible for the machines to learn from very fewer examples. Invention of a related computer chip, which is known as GPU or graphic processing unit, is turning out to be very meaningful and effective when it is being applied to types of calculations required for neural nets. Speed up of 10x times are also very much viable when the neural nets will move from traditional CPU to GPU.

Shares of NVIDIA on the other hand skyrocketed on its fourth-quarter results after the company reported a surprise earnings beat. RDI Initiates Coverage on: Cirrus Logic, Inc.   NVIDIA Corporation   Cirrus Logic's shares closed up 5.24% on almost 2.4 million shares traded on Friday. The gain came in after the company lost almost 12% of its value in early week after the audio chip developer reported disappointing third-quarter results last Monday. Due to a weak demand for smartphones, the company saw its revenue decline unexpectedly in the quarter. Cirrus also laid out a dismal outlook for the fourth quarter. Revenue for the third quarter fell 7.7% YOY to $482.7 million. Non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.59 were below the $1.77 analysts were expecting. Shares tumbled about 10% after the earnings release. Despite the weak demand in smartphones, the company assured that its position with key customers such as Apple is going strong. Apple represented 86% of the company's revenue as it is Cirrus' largest customer. In the second quarter the revenue from Apple was at 82%. Looking ahead at fourth quarter guidance for 2018, the company is expecting revenue to be in a range of $300 to $340 million, lower than the $370 million analysts had been waiting for. It expects gross margin between 48% and 50%. Access RDI's Cirrus Logic, Inc. Research Report at:   NVIDIA's shares closed up 6.69% this past Friday on nearly 42 million shares traded. Trading volume was nearly three times higher than usual after the company reported a surprise earnings beat on Thursday. Shares had already jumped as much as 14% in after-hours trading on Thursday. NVIDIA reported $2.91 billion in sales for the fourth quarter and adjusted profit of $1.72 share. This easily sailed by what Wall Street was expecting. Analysts were waiting for $2.68 billion in sales and adjusted profit of $1.16 per share. CEO Jensen Huang remarked, \"Industries around the world are racing to incorporate AI. Virtually every internet and cloud service provider has embraced our Volta GPUs. Hundreds of transportation companies are using our NVIDIA DRIVE platform. From manufacturing and healthcare to smart cities, innovators are using our platform to invent the future.\" Looking ahead the company expects sales of $2.84 billion to $2.96 billion in its next quarterly report.

{"link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/5-companies-riding-the-blockchain-wave-2018-02-13-818300", "text": "Published: LONDON, February 13, 2018 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ --\nLONDON, February 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ --   Blockchain can eventually affect every industry in the world--and make no mistake about it. Even if hyper-volatile cryptocurrencies are dipping and diving, the overall gains for many are thousand percentage points, and new multi-millionaires are being minted left and right. \u00a0Blockchain is its backbone-but it's so much more than cryptocurrency. It is a technology that will up-end every single industry on the planet. \u00a0Included in today's commentary: \u00a0Overstock.com, Inc. NVIDIA Corporation International Business Machines Corporation Innovation Shares NextGen Proto Eastman Kodak Company  And sometimes all it takes to revive a dead dinosaur of a company right now is a whisper of blockchain involvement. It's real. We are moving toward a cashless society. But the reality check gets even more exciting when we realize that if we think beyond the box of cryptocurrency, blockchain is reinventing the way we do EVERYTHING. From shipping and finance, to food packaging, gaming and healthcare. Absolutely everything. But the sheer size of the potential here poses an equally sizable problem for investors: How to get in on it without losing your shirt? Here are 5 stocks that could make it easy for investors to test the stormy blockchain sea:     Overstock has been the undeniable blockchain business leader, and its stock has been climbing all year, with few setbacks. There's constant news flow here, and it's being helped along by Overstock's fintech subsidiary, tZero, which just announced the purchase of a 24 percent stake in StockCross Financial Services, Inc. tZero is on the prowl to aggregate all components of its trading, clearing and settlement platform. It's looking to buy, build or partner, so the news flow is brilliant. It's a definite blockchain bull, but it's been completely reasonable and rational. That's what makes it one of the safest bets on blockchain. It's investing in companies on the cutting edge of development in the blockchain space, and its stock price shows that it's not scaring anyone away. At this point, while everyone has always thought of Overstock as just an internet merchant, it's time to start viewing this as a blockchain business. They've got their own cryptocurrency exchange, and the stock has gained 316 percent in the past 12 months.         How about this for a small, $64-million market cap company sitting on an ethereal goldmine? Anyone who missed the first crypto boat and is dying to get in on the most exciting market sector of our time is now wondering how, and this is easiest way: BLOC is a publicly traded blockchain \"private equity fund\" and \"incubator\" that you can get in on through your online brokerage account. Even better: The company is a blockchain mastermind. It's the brainchild of the same man who co-created Ethereum, Steven Nerayoff. Ethereum has gained over since its launch, with Nerayoff as its advisor. He was also a senior advisor to the Lisk Cryptocurrency project which now has a market cap of over . Not only are they investing in crypto projects (as one expects a hedge fund to)... But they are also incubating handpicked blockchain companies. The best part... You don't need to know anything about Bitcoin... blockchain... or have your own crypto investing system... Because you can add Global Blockchain to your portfolio with just a few clicks, and let the only publicly traded crypto investment team do the work for you. Global Blockchain has put together a core team that aims to be \"incubating\" 6-12 new digital currencies every year. This means that Global Blockchain will be providing the funding for these new currencies in return for an equity stake. BLOC's strategy is multi-pronged and aside from giving us an easy way to get in on the biggest market ever, this is its key attraction. It gives you exposure not only to the top trading tokens, but also early-in, exclusive access to the tokens that are expected to trade in the future. It covers large-cap, small-cap and pre-ICO/ICO tokens all at the same time. Average gains of top tokens like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple (among others) is mind-blowing. And beyond this, there is huge potential for growth. These are the precisely the types of tokens Global Blockchain is targeting, but exposure gets even better through BLOC's access to pre-ICO (initial coin offering) and ICO tokens. ICOs are sort of the \"wild west\" of the cryptocurrency world. There's not much transparency or regulation, so many of them are illegal scams. Those that aren't stand to be huge returners, and Global Blockchain has the experience to know the difference. After all, they are ICO masters with Ethereum and others to back them up. There's still more: BLOC is also building a portfolio of startups focused on blockchain-based services. That means acquiring \u2026 and tokenizing software that could further benefit blockchain. It even invested in Kodak One, and the price of Kodak jumped a whopping after it announced a crypto-currency deal. The Kodak ICO is expected at the end of this month and with BLOC's huge stake this is definitely one to watch. And then there's their partnership with  and its . Blockchain-and its rewards-are only limited by the imagination, and BLOC has plenty of imagination. We expect news to flow by hard and fast as they add new, exclusive projects.    Didn't think NVDA was a blockchain company? Well, it's not \u2026 and it is. When you pick it apart, it's one of the backbones: NVDA makes semiconductors to power cryptocurrency mining. NVDA is a major climber this year, and a long-time favorite when we talk about anything from artificial intelligence to blockchain. When stock prices go on a run for too long, the knee-jerk reaction can be a pullback out of fear that it's just too much of a good thing. We think this is a mistake when it comes to NVDA. This company is involved heavily in everything from autonomous vehicles, graphic processing, central processing units, computer gaming and blockchain \u2026 It's cornering tech on every level, and we think it's only at the beginning of its run.   IBM stock isn't doing great right now, despite a solid earnings call on 18 January. Stock is down around 4 percent over the past week. IBM reported Q4 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $5.18 on revenues of $22.54 billion. This is up from the same period a year ago, which recorded EPS of $5.01 on revenues of $21.77 billion. Figures were also up for the full year and slightly exceeded analyst estimates. So, IBM strengthened its position as the leading enterprise cloud provider and established itself as a blockchain leader for business. Still, stocks are down. Why? Because no one is yet convinced about the blockchain move, and this is a mistake. What they don't like are IBM's declining business signings and declining backlog, so they don't see the profit margins improving. But they're stuck in the past when they should be focusing on the future, and the future is blockchain. Right now, is a great time to buy IBM in our opinion. Buy on the dip, hold for the long term and ride the blockchain. What we're looking at is IBM's deal with shipping giant Maersk to form a new company to commercialize blockchain technology. IBM would hold 49 percent in this venture, which still doesn't have a name. It would help shippers, ports, customs offices, banks and other global supply chain stakeholders track freight and turn paperwork into digital records. This is huge, and no one's caught on yet.     Another safer way to get in on blockchain is through three ETFS that seek out real ties to blockchain. What we like about this is the flexibility because they can couple small blockchain companies with something like IBM, which Wall Street would relegate only to IT, not blockchain. This gives us a wide diversity for getting in on blockchain, and something that might not have startling returns, but is safer for the cautious investor.

Despite wild swings in digital currency, the underlying blockchain technology demonstrates more stability. With this in mind, investors are increasingly turning their interest to blockchain-focused enterprises, such   ), a company applying blockchain to logistics in the fintech sector. Processor developer  has seen its earnings soar as it provides technology to support the blockchain, while  received a boost from the sale of graphics processing units (GPUs) for cryptocurrencies and gamers. A shift of focus from digital commerce to using and investing in cryptocurrencies has seen  quadruple in value. Even tech giant  is exploring blockchain as a tool for payment systems and supply chains. More than just Bitcoin The usefulness of blockchain goes far beyond cryptocurrencies. It can provide user and product verification, smart contracts that automatically pay out on completion, and decentralized record keeping for more efficient supply chain management. It has the potential to radically improve logistics and financial technology, especially for organizations in the fast-growing cannabis sector that often cannot access traditional payment services. It also decentralizes control of information and financial transactions, removing the need for a central user vulnerable to error and fraud. This can simplify and remove many of the risks from transferring data and money. The that, by 2025, 10 percent of GDP will be stored using this technology. With these advantages, the importance of blockchain extend beyond the companies directly invested in it. Advanced processing facilities are needed to power the technology, which is leading to dramatic growth for companies specializing in processing technology. Investing Logistics  is one of the companies that has made blockchain part of a broader fintech platform. Founded in 2009, the company quickly established itself as a leading provider of payment solutions, allowing organizations to distribute money to employees and members worldwide. Global Payout's implementation of the Consolidated Payment Gateway (CPG) provided comprehensive, customized solutions for business customers' needs. Offering direct bank account, mobile account, and prepaid card account options for mobile user interfaces as well as prepaid cards, it served as a hub to international bank networks. This initial product allowed Global Payout to develop the experience needed for a broader, bolder approach to the fintech sector. Focusing on logistics, it built up both its software and its business, investing in new subsidiaries and financial support solutions. It provides an increasing range of logistical solutions for the financial sector while it remains grounded in blockchain and other disruptive technologies. This allows it to benefit from revolutionary technologies without being vulnerable to dramatic downturns, such as the recent swing against cryptocurrencies. Recognizing that the financial technology industry is a constantly evolving market, Global Payout quickly pivoted from its initial product. CEO James Hancock said, \"As the role and relevance of today's banks is shrinking, Global Payout is simultaneously helping the financial market to create better, faster, cheaper services for individuals, enterprises and governments.\" Launched in 2017, the Global Reserve Platform (\"GRP\") is the next generation of financial logistics from Global Payout. A customizable web-based financial platform, it lets users manage any financial product, new or old. This \"banking-in-a-box\" approach makes it easy for users to fulfill the front-to-back office processing requirements of foreign exchange and international payment service providers. At its heart is the Global Reserve Administrative module, which financial institutions can customize to create their own financial management solutions. GRP allows customers to securely and smoothly carry out a wide range of financial transactions. More traditional features such as prepaid credit and debit cards sit alongside mobile wallets as payment systems become increasingly integrated with users' mobile technology. Biometric payments and authentication systems allow extra security. Loans, grants, market orders, and international financial transactions can all be managed through the platform. Faster Supply Chain Finance Global Payout has expanded its reach through subsidiary companies. One of these is SecurCapital, a fintech supply chain finance company. Like GRP, SecurCapital's SecurCloud platform is there to serve the needs of businesses by supporting the smooth flow of finance. It specializes in supporting the mid-tier logistics industry - forwarders, government contractors, motor carriers and suppliers. Its integrated system provides online access to cash, including global payments and foreign exchange. This lets mid-tier companies maintain momentum through swift service and transactions. Faster than traditional payment collection processes, its disruptive technology optimizes cash flow through delivery of invoices, proof of delivery and payment transactions to global vendors. It's the sort of swift logistics made possible by blockchain. Leveraging cloud-based innovations to provide smoother service, SecurCloud will cut out many of the intermediaries and delays that come from the previous generation of banking solutions. It is being launched by SecurCapital through blockchain conferences in the United States, China, and the United Kingdom ( ). Support for High-Risk Innovators SecurCapital demonstrates how fintech innovation can create efficiencies for underserved companies in traditional sectors. But Global Payout is also extending its reach to new markets by providing fintech support to emerging high-risk markets. This is the work of another subsidiary, MoneyTrac Technology. MoneyTrac serves the needs of a fast-growing market - cannabis suppliers and ancillary services. The erratic nature of the legalization process means that many legal companies struggle to access the financial services they need to carry out their businesses. With the spreading legalization of medical marijuana and recreational legalization in California and Canada, this is a sector set to grow at an exponential rate. Traditional banks often won't provide the services that cannabis vendors need due to fears over the potential impact of federal laws. As a result, disruptive financial solutions such as those offered by MoneyTrac fill a vital space in the financial ecosystem. By providing payment technology outside of the traditional banking system, they allow fast, secure transactions for those otherwise relegated to the risks and logistical inefficiencies of the cash economy. MoneyTrac's customizable payment platform allows high-risk businesses to access systems in full compliance with the appropriate regulations, better carrying out and tracking their businesses. The company also offers business, branding and marketing consultancy so that customers can buy a full package of support. A Bigger Blockchain Picture The wider impact of blockchain is making itself felt across the fintech sector.   which provides processing hardware used by blockchain companies, has seen a rise in earnings off the back of the past year's cryptocurrency boom. In 2017, the company to blockchain companies. It's a relatively small part of the $5 billion in revenue the company produced last year, but a sign of how widely the benefits of blockchain have spread. The company now provides technology as suppliers adjust to the new market. AMD's biggest rival,  is in a similar position. Its GPUs sell to a range of markets, including gamers, data centers and blockchain companies. Blockchain is built upon large amounts of processing, and as the technology takes off, so will sales for the companies providing hardware and software. This led to a rise in earnings for NVIDIA in 2017, which appears set to continue in 2018.   owns 10 subsidiary blockchain companies, giving it a position of influence in the sector. Though primarily known for its operation as an online retailer, the company facilitates transactions in cryptocurrencies and runs a blockchain-powered currency exchange. This exchange is designed to , overcoming one of the main hurdles to blockchain - a perceived lack of regulatory compliance.   one of the most powerful and prestigious companies in the technology sector, also has its sights set on blockchain. Its focus is on exploring blockchain as a way of improving payment systems and supply chains. By reducing cash cycle time, increasing transaction visibility and cutting intermediaries, it's aiming to provide faster financial transactions and greater transparency. The company is investing in blockchain technology that will replace sole-source in-house record-keeping methods, improving oversight and efficiency for logistical and financial systems. If a company on IBM's scale is investing in blockchain, then we can be confident that it's more than just a bubble. Disruption is coming to the old financial systems. The needs of new markets such as the cannabis sector, and the drive for greater efficiency in businesses such as mid-tier supply chain, create opportunities for innovative companies. Those who embrace technologies such as blockchain as part of a balanced platform of services are likely to thrive in a period of disruption. For more information on Global Payout, visit: .

{"link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-the-big-blunder-that-many-average-investors-are-committing-now-2018-02-08", "text": "Published: Bond funds offer no safety from the stock market\u2019s decline By Many average investors are committing a blunder now. It\u2019s not all their fault, though, as information is often dumbed down in the interest of simplicity. As Einstein said: \u201cEverything should be made as simple as possible but not simpler.\u201d Unfortunately, often the information provided to average investors has been simplified below the bare minimum. To avoid the blunder, average investors need a bit of sophistication. To fully understand how to avoid the blunder, let us first start with a chart that illustrates the point. Read on for the blunder and how to avoid it.   Please click for the chart of iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF Please observe the following important points on the chart: \u2022 The chart shows that TLT has fallen about 18% from its recent peak. \u2022 An average investor who bought near the peak to collect about 2.75% interest has now lost about 18% of the principal. \u2022 If interest rates normalize even to the recent low levels, an average investor who bought near the peak will lose 42% of the principal.         Many average investors believe the myth that bonds are safe. There is some truth to the understanding that bonds are safer than stocks, but average investors miss an important nuance. If you buy an individual Treasury bond or a bond of a company with a solid balance sheet and hold it to maturity, you will get your principal back. However, this is not the case when you buy mutual funds or ETFs.   Many average investors are advised to start with 60% in stocks and 40% in bonds. Of course, adjustments are made based on age and objectives. Investors are told that stocks are for growth and bonds are for safety and income. Many average investors do not understand that they can lose a lot of money in bonds.   Bonds have been in a 30-year bull market. For this reason, the bad advice given to investors has not hurt them so far. However, average investors need to know that the bull market has ended.   As stock market volatility has risen, many average investors who want safety are moving out of stocks into bonds. They are doing so because they do not understand the following: \u2022 They can lose money in bonds, as illustrated in the chart linked above. \u2022 Interest rates are rising. \u2022 Bonds move inverse to interest rates. In plain English, when interest rates go higher, bonds go lower. \u2022 Stocks are experiencing volatility because of rising interest rates.   First and foremost, do not buy bond funds or ETFs. Second, understand that most funds and popular ETFs are concentrated in a handful of stocks that have run up and now pose a high risk. For example, the top holdings of popular ETF are Apple Microsoft and Facebook Alphabet  is right there too. These are also the top holdings of popular ETF along with Nvidia Netflix and Qualcomm  The point is that many investors are overly concentrated in technology stocks.

Though not Nvidia\u2019s largest business, the server segment is its fastest-growing. Revenue , to $606 million, ahead of the FactSet consensus estimate for 85% growth. That\u2019s one big reason why Nvidia shares gained in Friday morning trading. \u201cWe believe this dynamic demonstrates consistent demand for Nvidia\u2019s leading-edge data center products, driving [average selling price] and margin strength,\u201d wrote Oppenheimer analyst Rick Schafer. He noted that the company\u2019s V100 product already has a number of high-profile adopters, including Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. , Amazon.com Inc. Alphabet Inc.  , Baidu Inc. International Business Machines Corp. Microsoft Corp. Oracle Corp. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. Schafer has a perform rating on Nvidia shares.   Raymond James analyst Chris Caso is also optimistic about Nvidia\u2019s data-center business, pointing out that sales of Volta GPUs are still ramping up. \u201cWith only two cloud customers on Volta, the rest are still deploying Pascal-related boards, suggesting another strong leg up is yet to come in that market,\u201d he wrote. Caso added that the data-center business is likely the major factor behind Nvidia\u2019s big rally over the past year, with shares up 95% in that time versus a 12% gain for the S&P 500 and a 27% rise for the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index  \u201cWe don\u2019t think we\u2019re anywhere near the end of the Volta product cycle,\u201d he wrote, while maintaining an outperform rating. \u201cThe stock\u2019s valuation is of course high, but as long as the company keeps putting up quarters like this, and with future potential catalysts from auto and inferencing ahead, we believe shares will continue to move higher.\u201d Nvidia\u2019s automotive business , but analysts seemed nonetheless optimistic about that segment going forward. \u201cConcern over [whether] Nvidia can maintain the momentum fails to recognize an additional autonomous vehicle tailwind ramping significantly in FY20,\u201d wrote Needham\u2019s Rajvindra Gill, who has a buy rating on the stock. He raised his target price to $300 from $250. Cryptocurrency-related revenue delivered a nice boost to Nvidia\u2019s results during the latest quarter, given that its . With Ethereum prices down sharply, however, there\u2019s some debate over the potential impact of this business on Nvidia\u2019s results in the future. In a note titled \u201cLove the Data Center... Hate the Crypto,\u201d Susquehanna Financial Group analyst Christopher Rolland dubbed sales of GPUs for Ethereum mining a \u201clong-term negative\u201d for Nvidia. He noted that the company issued a strong forecast for its fiscal first quarter, which ends in April, and worries that \u201cpotentially fleeting crypto GPU sales may set 2Q18 guidance up poorly.\u201d Some analysts from Proof of Work protocol to Proof of Stake protocol in the first half of the year, which could hurt Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. Proof of Work requires GPU mining, while Proof of Stake doesn\u2019t. Rolland believes that Ethereum-related sales of GPUs may have exceeded $400 million in the fourth quarter of the calendar year. He has a neutral rating on shares, and he raised his price target to $215 from $200 following the results. Needham\u2019s Gill, who estimates about $140 million in crypto revenue for the fiscal fourth quarter, also warned that \u201chigh crypto mining demand and potential volatility could spill off and cause fluctuations in the Gaming business.\u201d Raymond James\u2019 Caso isn\u2019t concerned when he looks at the overall business. \u201cWhile investors are likely to question the sustainability of recent crypto-driven strength\u2014and its impact on tight supply\u2014management is taking a relatively conservative approach, assuming flat crypto demand in April and highlighting pent-up \u201ctraditional\u201d gaming-driven demand,\u201d he wrote.

Nvidia\u2019s numbers were eye-popping, especially for a company that has been public for nearly 20 years and experienced an annual sales decline just five years ago. The key numbers for Nvidia\u2019s 2018 fiscal year: , profit increased 83% (yes, that\u2019s GAAP) and gross margin increased by 110 basis points. Those numbers were just part of , which sent shares up more than 7% in late trading. Nvidia stock has already gained 83.4% in the past year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 23.9%, and that rise came on top of the biggest gains on the S&P 500 index in 2016. Nvidia\u2019s ride has been fueled by greater demand for its core product, graphics chips, which have found a home beyond videogames thanks to their usefulness in machine learning. The general bull theory is that Nvidia\u2019s core gaming business will continue to grow thanks to the rise of esports and more graphically-intense videogames, while new businesses selling chips for servers and autonomous cars will eventually be huge. With its fourth-quarter report, Nvidia lived up to two parts of that theory. The core gaming business, which has been boosted by demands for those same chips , grew nearly 36% to more than $5.5 billion in revenue, more than Nvidia\u2019s revenue total in any year before the previous one. The server business, meanwhile, came close to $2 billion in annual revenue, after failing to touch $1 billion the year before and mostly failing to exist before that. The one laggard so far is the automotive business, which declined sequentially in the fourth quarter and grew less than 15% for the full year. The results were below analysts\u2019 average expectations for the second quarter in a row. Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress said on a conference call Thursday that Nvidia automotive sales fell as its ditches a longtime business of providing chips that power in-car systems to next-generation auto supplies. \u201cThe sequential decline reflects our transition from infotainment, which is becoming commoditized, to next-generation AI cockpit systems and complete top-to-bottom self-driving-vehicle platforms built on Nvidia hardware and software,\u201d Kress said. Nvidia , including a focus on and new in-car experiences involving augmented reality. Based on Thursday\u2019s commentary, we may see Nvidia\u2019s auto business struggle a bit before they realize any gains from their plans for the future. The Xavier processor, a chip with 9 billion transistors that Nvidia calls the most complex system-on-a-chip ever created, is expected to eventually drive its automotive business. It will act as the heart of its Nvidia Drive ecosystem, a platform it has developed for car makers to use to create safe self-driving cars. Nvidia Chief Executive Jensen Huang told analysts that he believes the really big revenue from automotive will begin in about 2019 to 2020, when auto makers, startups, taxi companies, ride-hailing companies and others begin to order self-driving capabilities in their vehicles and fleets. He revealed that the brains for self-driving cars will sell for an average of about $500 to $1,000, while those for \u201crobo-taxis,\u201d as Nvidia refers to autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, will command several thousand dollars each. The upside for Nvidia\u2019s automotive business is expected to come from software, bigger volumes of its chips and for self-driving cars. Stacy Rasgon, a Bernstein Research analyst, wrote in a recent note that he expects growth in automotive \u201cto come from software development agreements related to autonomous driving at some point this year,\u201d he said. Investors who have bought into Nvidia are reaping rewards from gaming, cryptocurrency and a booming server business right now, but the automotive business still needs some gas. If that business is as big as Nvidia has claimed, shares could keep driving higher. Join the conversation Copyright \u00a9 2018 MarketWatch, Inc.  All rights reserved.

In a Thursday report, S&P Global Ratings warned investors that \u201cthe technology sector may never look the same again,\u201d now that the U.S. tax overhaul will allow for tech giants to bring back billions of dollars from overseas coffers. While viewed as an overall positive, it could also result in more fast and loose financial policies that could damage creditworthiness in the sector. Earlier in the week, on signs of weakening earnings. S&P said it believes \u201cthe overall industry credit profile will weaken over time, largely because of the potential for more aggressive financial policies in response to greater access to overseas cash.\u201d Resulting lower cash balances will result in weaker credit metrics ultimately, S&P said, and those aggressive financial policies appear to be key. S&P noted: \u201cIf an issuer adopts a more aggressive financial policy than we expect after repatriation, likely through additional share repurchases, its credit metrics could deteriorate based upon our policy of netting surplus cash against debt, potentially leading to rating or outlook revisions. Generally, we will not deduct surplus cash from debt if a company is (1) owned by a financial sponsor as defined in our criteria, or (2) has a business risk profile at the lower end of the scale (i.e., weak or vulnerable as described in our criteria).\u201d S&P points to \u2019s recent announcement that it plans to go from having and said the tech giant could be a trend setter for the industry.    \u201cWe anticipate that other large cash holders will also announce enhanced shareholder returns over time,\u201d S&P said. Topping that list along with Apple is the only AAA-rated tech issue  along with     and   Then, there are those companies who have as much about as much debt as they have cash to repatriate. Should those companies use the repatriated cash to return to shareholders and still hold on to the debt, that could be harmful to their rating.    S&P noted: Unlike issuers with large net cash positions, we believe those that have both high cash and debt balances face potential credit risks because they may choose to use substantial portions of now-accessible foreign cash for shareholder returns. These issuers, some of which have modest net cash positions or are in net debt positions, will have to manage a delicate balance between equity holders and debtholders. Depletion of cash, if not offset by some debt reduction, can raise leverage by our calculation and lead us to consider a downgrade. S&P used Oracle as an example, pointing out that while it has $72 billion in cash, about 35% of its market cap, it also has $61 billion in debt so its net cash is relatively low, at about 5% of market cap. Other companies in this boat include    and  S&P said. \u201cWe believe companies with these types of balance sheets will have to clarify their financial policies to both equity and bond investors over the coming quarters as cash comes back on shore,\u201d according to S&P. Tech companies that have seen their stocks underperform over the past year or so are particularly vulnerable, because there\u2019s more incentive to return money to shareholders to boost stock prices. S&P said: We are very attentive to the repatriation-related earnings call comments from issuers whose share prices have underperformed the overall market during the past year. Issuers with meaningful cash balances offshore are likely engaged in deep board-level discussions to finalize their capital allocation strategies and we have already heard from some management commenting about \u201creturn of excess capital\u201d to shareholders. We believe that management of companies whose share prices have lagged the market will feel greater pressure to appease the shareholders through aggressive share repurchases or risky acquisitions. One example S&P used was  Over the past 12 months, shares of Juniper have declined 8%, compared with the 15% gain in the S&P 500 index and the 22% rise in the Nasdaq Composite Index  On the other hand, companies like  and  which are up 90% and 70%, respectively, over the past 12 months, will have a lot more flexibility with the timing a size of shareholder returns and will likely be better able to balance stock and bondholder needs, S&P said.
