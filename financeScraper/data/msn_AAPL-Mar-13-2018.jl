Acquires Historical Copper-Cobalt-Nickel Property", "text": "VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cameo Resources Corp. (TSX Venture:CRU) (OTC:CRUUF) (FWB:SY7D) (the \u201cCompany\u201d or \u201cCameo Resources\u201d) is pleased to announce it entered an agreement to acquire 100% of the Gochager Lake Nickel-Copper-Cobalt project claims from U.S. Lithium Corp. (the \u201dVendor\u201d). The project, which consists of four claims covering 3,759 hectares, is located in northern Saskatchewan approximately 75 km north of the town of La Ronge. Historical exploration has identified semi-massive and massive Ni-Cu occurrences with significantly elevated levels of cobalt, a vital component in the manufacture of the latest generation of lithium ion batteries.  The Gochager Lake Nickel-Copper-Cobalt project includes reported drill assay results of up to 3.20% nickel, 6.52% copper and 0.22% cobalt (from the Saskatchewan Mineral Deposit Index [SMDI #0880] and the Vendor\u2019s 2017 technical report on the Gochager Lake Ni-Cu-Co Project).  A selected grab sample assayed 3.1% Ni, 0.09% Cu, and 0.23% Co.  Cobalt mineralization is noted as co-occurring with the nickel and copper, but most historical drill holes lack cobalt analyses. The SMDI also reports assay values as high as 3.92% Ni, 0.70% Cu and 2.86% Co from drilling, although the Vendor\u2019s 2017 technical report notes that 2 subsequent re-analyses did not replicate that very high Co value. Historical resource estimates that do not meet the standards of National Instrument 43-101 were generated in 1968 and 1990 and are reported in the SMDI as well as the 2017 technical report. The 1968 resource for the Gochager deposit estimated 4.3 million tons grading 0.30% Ni and 0.08% Cu.  In 1990, J.S. Steel reported that vertical and longitudinal sections were constructed from the existing data and an orebody with reasonably well defined limits was defined containing 1.8 million tons at 0.735% nickel-equivalent.  A qualified person has not done sufficient work to classify the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves, and the Company is not treating the historical estimate as current mineral resources or mineral reserves.  However, the historical resources do point to the potential of the project to host a deposit. Under the terms of the agreement, Cameo will issue 1 million common shares and pay US$60,000 to the Vendor. In addition, the Company agrees to incur development expenditures of US$225,000 on or prior to July 12, 2019. The Company will also issue an aggregate of 200,000 common shares to the parties from whom the Vendor acquired the project in order to obtain those parties\u2019 consent to extending the deadline to incur development expenditures from 2018 to 2019. Additionally, one of the parties from whom the Vendor acquired the project will retain a 2% net smelter royalty on the claims. The Company will have the right to buy back 1% of the NSR for a purchase price of US$1.25 million. The transaction is subject to the approval of the TSX Venture Exchange, and all shares issued under the transaction will be subject to a four month hold period. Background and Technical Summary Nickel-copper-cobalt sulphide mineralization was discovered at Gochager Lake, located in the La Ronge meta-volcanic belt, in the mid-1960s with subsequent exploration carried out mainly by the Scurry-Rainbow Oil Company Limited. Exploration activities included soil sampling, trenching of gossans, geophysical surveys and diamond drilling. A total of 85 mostly vertical drill holes (total of 27,400 m) delineated the mineralized Gochager A-Zone (or Main Zone) with a strike length of 330 meters, widths of up to 120 meters, and depths of up to 305 meters. The Gochager A-Zone mineralization consists of disseminated mm-cm size blebs of sulphide, net-textured sulphide and, in places, semi-massive to massive sulphide pods.  Examination of the available geological and geophysical data, plus first-hand experience on the property by a senior Ni-Cu-PGE consultant, indicates the property has some very positive exploration attributes not previously recognized. These include:  Harrison Cookenboo, Ph.D., P.Geo., is a qualified person as defined in National Instrument 43-101. He has reviewed and is responsible for the technical information presented in this news release. Akash Patel, President of Cameo states, \u201cCobalt prices are trading at 10-year highs, as demand continues to surge and very little supplementary supply to compensate has emerged. The demand for battery metals appears to be at the beginning of long-term bullish cycle. Cameo continues to tactically position itself for the enviable stampede to secure sustainable energy metal deposits. Recently, Apple Inc. announced it is in negations to purchase cobalt directly from miners with sustainable supply chains and legitimate extraction practices. Cobalt is a critical ingredient in lithium-ion batteries that power Apple\u2019s iPhones, iPads, Apple Watch, and MacBooks. The Company is very much excited to have secured a cobalt project with such a high degree potential to capitalize on this megatrend.\u201d  On behalf of the Board of Directors, CAMEO RESOURCES CORP.\u201cAkash Patel\u201d                                    Akash Patel President For further information, please contact Akash PatelPresident604-446-6440Email: akashp006@gmail.com www.cameoresources.com  Neither the TSX Venture Exchange nor its Regulation Services Provider (as that term is defined in the policies of the TSX Venture Exchange) accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) | Seeking Alpha", "text": "SummaryThe weakening USD has the potential to goose revenue numbers for international corporations like Apple much higher.Other tech giants like IBM have seen outsized, positive impact from the weaker USD and expect it to continue.While hedging programs may add to expenses, a continuing weaker dollar could catalyze Apple revenue numbers higher.Apple (AAPL), a multinational corporation known for its popular iPhone handset, is no stranger to foreign currency issues. We last described Apple's currency headwinds nearly a year ago:\"For US multinationals that sell products overseas, however, the strong US dollar makes these products more expensive and less competitive in the foreign marketplaces. Especially for Apple, which sells products that are already notoriously expensive, the potential impact of a strong dollar compared to international currencies smacks the bottom line.\"Dollar ExpectationsToday, as we look to the recent past and the remainder of Apple's Q2, it appears that the opposite effect is now in place. For the last three months, the USD index has fallen from roughly 4%, from $94.10 to around $90 today, going as low as $88.50 a few weeks ago. The trend down from the mid-$90s to the $89-90 range has been realized in many US multinationals already. Alejo Czerwonko of UBS (NYSE:UBS) recently commented on dollar expectations, claiming a return to strength of the US dollar against global commodities is unlikely in 2018. The improving emerging economies have strengthened those currencies against the dollar, and they remain poised to continue the strength:\"EM is better positioned now that it has been in the past. The fundamentals [in EM economies] are stronger, the macro picture is better and the aggregate current account deficits have improved.\"This indicates that the EM currencies may continue their strength against the USD. Additionally, the European Central Bank appears satisfied with the strengthening euro - currently unconcerned of any negative implications associated with such. Also, recent \"mixed messages\" about wage growth in the most recent February US jobs report has left the USD middling, including among the reasons the \"uncertainty\" around US trade protectionism amid President Trump's new tariff proposals. Shaun Osbourne of Scotiabank includes the tariff issues as another red flag for the USD:We remain cautious on the outlook for the U.S. dollar and reiterate that tariff action - even on a limited scale - has not reflected positively on the dollar overall in the past...Generally speaking, we think that protectionist regimes do not necessarily support a strong domestic currency either.\"What could the weakness of the USD mean for Apple's numbers?How Does a Weak US Dollar Effect Multinationals?In general, a weaker USD indicates that sales conducted overseas in foreign currencies become more valuable when converted back to USD. Indeed, in January just six weeks ago, the USD fell to a three-year low, \"boosting optimism\" for earnings going forward. As the chart below illustrates, Apple's overseas sales are a large part of its total revenues. Last quarter, Q4 2017, for instance, over 60% of its revenues were generated overseas: To update with the latest quarter (Q4), Apple received upwards of 62% of its Q4 revenue from abroad.", "tick": "AAPL"}

The portfolio is nicknamed the MnM portfolio, which is a moniker for \u201cMinne(sota) \u2018n Monthly.\u201dNote: The portfolio remains at 38 stocks. I am still working towards a target portfolio size of ~40. I feel that at this level the portfolio holds a sufficient number of stocks such that I can effectively follow them all. I will work towards achieving more equal weightings, as this will provide strong diversification, with each stock representing approximately 2-3% of the portfolio total. I also receive 100 free trades each year from my brokerage, so I can trade in small quantities without worry about brokerage trading costs.That being said, here\u2019s what happened in February.February 2018February was a pretty ugly month for stock valuations. The portfolio saw a ~4.4% decline, slightly worse than the ~3.9% decline in the S&amp;P 500. I continue to expect some drag in price performance until the selling in REITs subsides and we see some stabilization in prices. It seems premature to me to call this the bottom in REITs; but at the time of writing, REITs have recovered some in March. We\u2019ll see if it holds and if the pressure on REITs subsides.I have captured the activity for February and for the year to date in the standard rollforward summary below. The portfolio collected $318.22 in dividends and interest during the month, all of which was recurring on positions held, with the exception $.01 of interest.The portfolio was comprised of the following securities as of February 28, 2018: The following sections go into greater detail of the events that have occurred since the end of January.SalesNone.AdditionsThis month was one where I focused on adding shares to positions I saw as having attractive fundamentals. I wrote about my fundamental review a few weeks back, and specifically noted that I liked what I saw in First Horizon (NYSE:FHN) as well as STAG Industrial (NYSE:STAG), among several others. I added to those two positions this month.I also added more shares of VEREIT, Inc. (NYSE:VER), which continues to trade at a depressed multiple. I view this as being an opportunistic purchase, as the company has not received any credit for the steps it has taken in turning the business around. I am looking for some multiple expansion later this year, particularly if the REIT is able to get through its long-standing legal issues. In the meantime, I am happy with an outsized yield. Dividends Collected As noted earlier, I collected $318.22 in dividends during the month, all but $.01 of which was recurring on positions held.

I don't think Apple has overlooked these criticisms. Instead, I think the company has a long-term plan to stay out of the war for consumers' attention \u2014 and is actually moving away from plowing everything through our iPhones. By making its technology more passive, Apple is sacrificing short-term sales momentum to spare us the omnipresent competition for our attention. As we become more and more surrounded by screens, I believe people will come to appreciate the technologies that can be stowed away, only activating when we look at them or talk to them, instead of demanding our attention. That's the feeling one achieves with products like AirPods or the Apple Watch, or when screens are activated by Face ID. Apple is frequently, and somewhat incorrectly, lumped in with other technology companies as driving \"addiction\" to technology. Most recently, the company has made headlines after two investors called for Apple to invest in parental controls. Stanford students also protested at Apple headquarters about smartphone addiction. But Apple almost entirely avoids products that dominate your attention: This is why they have not invested as heavily in products like social media, games and movies, except when it comes to specific use cases.  Instead, Apple has invested in hosting augmented reality, music and podcasts. The important thing about these forms of media is that while they can captivate, they can also be ambient. A Facebook feed or a VR headset, on the other hand, cannot be consumed absent your full attention. Unlike advertising-based or purchase-based companies like Android, Apple does not gain much from how much you use their devices. Apple only benefits when you believe the uses cases for the device are superior enough to pay for. If a technology proves useful, you may want to use it often. But just because you always want to use a technology doesn't necessarily make it useful. Apple wants devices that fall in the former category, and many other companies rely on the latter.  Most companies that make Apple-like devices use them to drive eyeballs back to more profitable services \u2014 think of Snapchat's Spectacles, Google's search advertising, and Amazon's Prime service as examples of products that turn a real-life request into a \"flywheel\" that forces users to continue to engage with the product. Many criticisms that Apple has failed to innovate are simply misconstruing Apple's refusal to make attention-dominating functionality the core of its product. I think this is indicative of a fundamental divide forming among big technology companies around how best to create immersive technology. Some companies are working on experiences that melt the world away and draw you into them \u2014 this is what happens when we binge on Netflix, scroll endlessly on Instagram and put on a virtual reality headset. Then there are companies, like Apple, working to make technology so seamless that it fades into the activities we are already doing \u2014 that's what happens when we subscribe to products on Amazon or check our activity trackers on the Apple Watch. While all technology claims to add convenience to our lives, some do it in a way that aims to monopolize our attention, while with and other companies take the feeling of \"technology\" out of technology. By limiting its impact on content and advertising, Apple could purposely be letting its technology fade into the background \u2014 and while it might not result in short-term sales, the company could be rewarded in the long run.", "tick": "AAPL"}

If you haven't used it before, here's what it is and how it works. Texture says it provides access to more than 200+ magazines.  It's $9.99 a month after a 7-day free trial, but you get unlimited access to all of the magazines the app offers, including popular ones like GQ, Men's Journal, Vanity Fair, Time, The New Yorker, Esquire, National Geographic and more. There's plenty to choose from. You can scroll through the app and pick magazines sorted by alphabetical order. It shows me the current issues as well as past issues.  You see the cover of a magazine once you click into it. You navigate through the pages by swiping across the screen. You can also pinch to zoom in on text. It's kind of hard to read this way, since the text on an iPhone is small and you need to pan around a page. It's probably much better on an iPad. I think I have an idea. Apple's News application is one of the best out there, and Texture could help Apple build on that with access to even more magazines. It could, for example, fill Apple News with even more stories from magazines you subscribe to or favorite from the service.

Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, said in a note Tuesday that the next 12 to 18 months is a \"pivotal window\" for both tech giants to secure rights to various professional sports programs. This story will play out over the next few years with Amazon and Facebook likely to become big contenders to win the right to stream games, he said. \"We note in 2021, the year when the NFL, MLB and NHL media rights deals mostly end, will be the first major opportunity for Amazon, Facebook and other major tech streaming platforms to potentially bid on some of these rights versus the likes of traditional entrenched media/cable players,\" Ives said. Both Facebook and Amazon have been upping their spending on original content through their respective video streaming platforms, Facebook Watch and Prime Video. Facebook, for example, is willing to spend as much as $1 billion this year, according to a Wall Street Journal report, while Ives estimated Amazon could spend upward of $5 billion. The analyst sees much of this budget being directed towards sports, just as many sports rights deals come to an end, allowing tech companies the chance to get in on the action. \"We will be watching this sports content battle closely over the coming year, as well as the success/engagement from the Facebook MLB endeavor, as it could be a sign of things to come with streaming platforms playing a bigger role in global professional sports broadcasting rights in the years ahead and potentially shaking up this market, while adding a major notch on the content belts of Amazon, Facebook and other new tech entrants to this arena.\" Ives is referencing the recently-announced deal that will see Facebook exclusively stream 25 Major League Baseball (MLB) games this season. Last year, the social networking giant secured the rights to some professional soccer games and earlier this year announced plans to stream pro-surfing. Ives said that along with the MLB deals, the move shows that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is \"in the early strategic steps of building out a massive wave of sports content spending over the coming few years.\" Amazon has already streamed some NFL Thursday Night Football games and Ives said the e-commerce giant could also bid for the U.K.'s Premier League soccer rights against British incumbents Sky and BT. Ives noted that Google and Apple remain \"wild cards\" in the battle for live sports content, with Snap and Twitter \"tangentially in the mix.\" Rising competition from the tech giants in the content space comes amid increasing consolidation in the media landscape. Disney is currently waiting for a deal to buy many parts of 21st Century Fox to close. And Comcast has put in a $31 billion bid for Sky. Both deals are seen to boost the acquirers sports offerings. Ives said that Disney's acquisition of Fox will add 22 regional sports networks to its flagship ESPN network. Meanwhile, in the U.K., Sky is one of the dominant players in sports broadcasting. Disney is also planning to launch its own streaming service that would compete with the likes of Amazon, Netflix and Facebook. Disney CEO Bob Iger told CNBC in February that the company's ESPN Plus sports streaming service would cost $4.99 a month.
