Together ,annual subscriptions to these authors' services add up to thousands of dollars per year. I'm very grateful to the authors for giving us a glimpse at what they buying and why. The ideas are eclectic, ranging from deep value and special situations to momentum and growth ideas. I asked them all four simple questions about their best idea, which are essential to an investment thesis. Here are their answers, in no particular order (they're slightly edited for clarity):1. EquinixBill Stoller is the REIT-master at REITS4Alpha who's fascinated by technology as well. His subscribers rate his service 4.9 stars. I happen to know, sometimes he's funny too. He recommends Equinix (EQIX).How much can I make?Equinix shares dropped to $403 after Q4'17 cc, or 19% below NAV of $483 per share. This is an unusual opportunity to buy Equinix shares significantly below intrinsic value. Equinix is the top-rated data center REIT by sell-side analysts, with a consensus 12-month target price of ~$525 per share.How much can I lose?In a bearish market for REITs, there could be another 10% or so risk to the downside, if the Fed becomes ultra-hawkish due to inflation fears. I see an asymmetrical risk/reward with upside of 30%.Why is the market missing this opportunity? Mr. Market has put EQIX in the penalty-box for a pair of acquisitions made at high EBITDA multiples, which will be dilutive to AFFO/share for about a year prior to paying off in 2019-2020, and beyond. The large Verizon (29) data center acquisition which closed last year is also a short-term drag on EBITDA margins. Longer term these deals are home runs. Equinix capital deployed organically to expand existing IBX data centers is underwritten at 30% cash on cash returns at stabilization. Notably, EQIX can fund the majority of this growth through free cash flow -- unusual for a property REIT. Many investors do not understand the upside. The embedded ability to grow EBITDA by leasing existing capacity in Metronode (10) data centers in Australia and Informart Dallas. In addition to the latest M&amp;A deals mentioned above; it is difficult for analysts to model this pair of ~$800M acquisitions set to close mid-year 2018. Why is it going up in 2018? Equinix has successfully integrated close to 20 M&amp;A deals in addition to growing organically over the past 20-years. The C-Suite is investing in the long-term by snapping up irreplaceable data center assets to bolster its global interconnection moat of ~200 IBX data centers in major metros around the world. Notably, all Equinix data centers sit on top of key network and fiber-dense locations. I expect Equinix management to do a better job of communicating the revenue synergies and strategic nature of recent acquisitions (Metronode &amp; Dallas Infomart) in upcoming presentations and conferences, including hosting an Analyst Day in mid-2018. When these two deals close, 45% of EQIX revenue will be from owned data centers, a factor for ratings agencies to upgrade EQIX to investment grade -- another potential catalyst for EQIX shares. Dallas Infomart $800M deal in particular (a surprise announcement on day of earnings), has a huge upside of 11MW in the existing 1.6 million SF building; and entitlements to build a 40MW Annex on the property. Ratings agencies reaffirmed its BB+ balance sheet the day after announcement. Big picture: Equinix benefits from secular shifts toward cloud computing, streaming media, growth of big data/AI, Virtual Reality, Enterprise adoption of hybrid IT and need to access multiple cloud and SaaS providers, new sub-sea cable routes, etc. All contribute to the growth of data transmission -- the lifeblood of Equinix. Additional color: Various industry ecosystems have evolved over years in each EQIX metro, with high-value cross-connections between Enterprise and multiple cloud and SaaS on-ramps, networks, IT and managed service providers, as well as customers, supply chains and global employees. This interconnection-based retail colocation business model is a moat which protects margins, reduces churn, and allows Equinix to sell incremental space, power and cross-connects to curated customers, likely to \"land and expand.\" Equinix has ~10,000 global customers, more than all other publicly traded data center companies combined. Bottom line: The ability for EQIX grow AFFO/share in double-digits, and boost the dividend by mid-teens annually is uncanny for an S&amp;P 500 company, especially for a large-cap REIT with over a $30B market cap.", "tick": "NVDA"}

Investors who put $10,000 in Amazon on March 9, 2009 \u2014 when the S&amp;P 500 hit its closing low during the financial crisis \u2014 would have $250,000 today. Amazon, which closed at $60.49 per share on that date, has risen more than 2,000 percent since then. On Thursday, the stock closed at $1,551.86. The bull market began nine years ago on Friday. The date marked the \"Haines Bottom.\" Before the open on March 10, 2009, CNBC anchor Mark Haines called the bottom of the financial crisis on air. Of course for the rest of us, calling the market bottom and buying Amazon at those exact levels would have been nearly impossible. Still, it's a useful exercise to look at these returns to illustrate how sometimes the best time to buy is when others are most fearful. Investing in popular tech name Nvidia would have yielded even bigger returns. Investors who bet $10,000 on the chipmaker back then would have more than $300,000 today. Between the market bottom and now, Nvidia rose more than 2,700 percent. Other stocks that would have yielded strong returns for investors include J.P. Morgan Chase and Expedia.", "tick": "NVDA"}

But such a fund DOES exist.The Global X Robotics &amp; Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) drops a golden opportunity into investors\u2019 laps as a way to capture part of the growing movement behind automation.The fund currently has an impressive $2.2 billion in assets under management. The universal trend of preferring automation over human labor is spreading with each passing day. Suffice to say there is the unfortunate emotional element of sacking a human and the negative knock on effect to the local community like in Detroit, Michigan.But simply put, robots do a better job, don\u2019t complain, don\u2019t fall ill, don\u2019t join unions, or don\u2019t ask for pay rises. It\u2019s all very much a capitalist\u2019s dream come true.Instead of dallying around in single stock symbols, now is the time to seize the moment and take advantage of the single seminal trend of our lifetime.No, it\u2019s not online dating, gambling, or bitcoin, it\u2019s Artificial Intelligence.Selecting individual stocks that are purely exposed to A.I. is a challenging endeavor. Companies need a way to generate returns to shareholders first and foremost, hence, most pure A.I. plays do not exist right now. However, the Mad Hedge Fund Trader has found the most unadulterated A.I. play out there. A real diamond in the rough. The best way to expose yourself to this A.I. trend is through Global X Robotics &amp; Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ).This ETF tracks the price and yield performance of ten crucial companies that sit on the forefront of the A.I. and robotic development curve. It invests at least 80% of its total assets in the securities of the underlying index. The expense ratio is only 0.68%.Another caveat is that the underlying companies are only derived from developed countries. Out of the 10 disclosed largest holdings, seven are from Japan, two are from Silicon Valley, and one, ABB Group, is a Swedish-Swiss multinational headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland.Robotics and A.I. walk hand in hand, and robotics are entirely dependent on the germination prospects of A.I. Without A.I., robots are just a clunk of heavy metal.Robots require a high level of A.I. to meld seamlessly into our workforce. The stronger the A.I. functions, the stronger the robot\u2019s ability, filtering down to the bottom line.A.I. embedded robots are especially prevalent in military, car manufacturing, and heavy machinery. The industrial robot industry projects to reach $80 billion per year in sales by 2024 as more of the workforce gradually becomes automated.The robotic industry has become so prominent in the automotive industry that they constitute greater than 50% of robot investments in America.Let\u2019s get the ball rolling and familiarize readers of the Mad Hedge Technology Letter with the top 5 weightings in the underlying ETF (BOTZ). Nvidia (NVDA) Nvidia Corporation is a company I often write about as their main business is producing GPU chips for the video game industry.This Santa Clara, California based company is spearheading the next wave of A.I. advancement by focusing on autonomous vehicle technology and A.I. integrated cloud data centers as their next cash cow.All these new groundbreaking technologies require ample amounts of GPU chips. Consumers will eventually cohabitate with state of the art IOT products (internet of things), fueled by GPU chips, coming to mass market like the Apple Homepod.The company is led by genius Jensen Huang, a Taiwanese American, who cut his teeth as a microprocessor designer at competitor Advanced Micro Devices (AMD).Nvidia constitutes a hefty 9.38% of the BOTZ ETF.To visit their website please click here.Yaskawa Electric (Japan)Yaskawa Electric is the world's largest manufacturer of AC Inverter Drives, Servo and Motion Control, and Robotics Automation Systems, headquartered in Kitakyushu, Japan.It is a company I know well, having covered this former zaibatsu company as a budding young analyst in Japan 45 years ago.Yaskawa has fully committed to improve global productivity through Automation. It comprises 7.83% of BOTZ.To visit Yaskawa\u2019s website, please click here.Intuitive Surgical (ISRG)Intuitive Surgical Inc (ISRG) trades on Nasdaq and is located in sun drenched Sunnyvale, California.This local firm designs, manufactures, and markets surgical systems and is industriously focused on the medical industry.The company's da Vinci Surgical System converts surgeon's hand movements into corresponding micro-movements of instruments positioned inside the patient.The products include surgeon's consoles, patient-side carts, 3-D vision systems, da Vinci skills simulators, and da Vinci Xi integrated table motions.This company comprises 7.93% of BOTZ. To visit their website, pleaseclick here.Fanuc Corp. (Japan)Fanuc was another one of the hit robotics companies I used to trade in during the 1970\u2019s, and I have visited their main factory many times.The 4th largest portion in the (BOTZ) ETF at 7.84% is Fanuc Corp. This company provides automation products and computer numerical control systems, headquartered in Oshino, Yamanashi.They were once a subsidiary of Fujitsu, which focused on the field of numerical control. The bulk of their business is done with American and Japanese auto makers and electronics manufacturers.They have snapped up 65% of the world wide market in the computerized numerical device market (CNC). Fanuc has branch offices in 46 different countries.To visit their company website, please click here.Keyence Corp (Japan)Keyence Corp is the leading supplier of automation sensors, vision systems, barcode readers, laser markers, measuring instruments, and digital microscopes.They offer a full array of service support and closely work with customers to guarantee full functionality and operation of the equipment. Their technical staff and sales teams add value to the company by cooperating with its buyers.They have been consistently ranked as the top 10 best companies in Japan and boast an eye opening 50% operating margin.They are headquartered in Osaka, Japan and and make up 8.02% of the BOTZ ETF.To visit their website please click here.(BOTZ) does has some pros and cons. The best AI plays are either still private at the venture capital level or have already been taken over by giant firms like NVIDIA. You also need to have a pretty broad definition of AI to bring together enough companies to make up an decent ETF.However, it does get you a cheap entry into many for the illiquid foreign names in this fund.Automation is one of the reasons why this is turning into the deflationary century and I recommend all readers who don\u2019t own their own robotic led business, pick up some Global X Robotics &amp; Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ).And by the way, the entry point right here on the charts is almost perfect.To learn more about (BOTZ) please visit their website by clicking here.", "tick": "NVDA"}

That's typically when I survey the landscape of tech websites to see what's 'in' and what's 'up.'Then I realize through this exercise ... nope, I haven't fallen out of touch after all.If you take a moment once in a while to scour the breadth of tech websites like I do, you'll quite quickly ask yourself, \u201cWhere is all the innovation?\u201d For example, just head over to The Verge's tech columns and you'll see headlines like this: Xiaomi\u2019s Mi Mix 2s might have a camera notch in the top-right corner Chaval\u2019s heated Supernova gloves also work great with touchscreens Apple patented a keyboard that can\u2019t be defeated by crumbs Some of these vary from \"I don't really care\" to \"well that's neat, but wait\u2026 this is 2018...\"We could go all day about this really. Hop over to Tech Crunch and the headlines are not only of the same theme but are actually reporting the same exact not-so-innovative ideas: Snapchat (SNAP) removes Giphy feature due to racial slur GIF (Tech Crunch's Link) (The Verge's Link) Google makes it easier to create custom Assistant commands for devices (Tech Crunch's Link) (The Verge's Link) Tech news is so slow that the same topics are reported prolifically across many of the mainstream tech websites. And of course, it still doesn't send shivers down my spine about the next revolution in technology.I mean think about it - the iPhone X, while cool to some, isn't a technological advancement if all we hear about is how the screen has a \"notch\" at the top. If it was revolutionary, we'd hear how users are transforming their worlds with AR and VR and other \u201dRs.\u201d Sadly, that's not the case - as easily evidenced by the boring headlines.At least not yet.Instead, the big names in tech like Google (GOOG)(GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), and Facebook (FB) are all developing chips. Sure, they\u2019re still producing these cool features and incrementally new gadgets - which are still hard to rationalize needing in our everyday lives - but they aren't focused there. Why is that? They are focused on producing the chips which will propel all those devices into the next wave of technological revolution. This is why innovation to the consumer, for the time being, has stalled.We can all see the movie trailer for the future and it goes something like this: \"In a world where your thoughts matter, and your brain waves and interactions are seamlessly transformed into the comfort and convenience you've always desired ... you are your own best friend - and this is the power behind it all.\"Or something like that.But, you get my drift. I'm not revealing any sort of secret here. Just look at the discussion about these reports and the speculative nature of what it all means. Amazon is one of the latest reports and many speculate how it's working hard to make AI (artificial intelligence) the center of its products.And while these large tech companies which focus on end users directly for their income are working hard at developing these chips, it's the ones in the business for decades which understand and can produce the fruits of difficult R&amp;D which are currently benefiting. To many consumers this is behind-the-scenes, don't-really-care-just-make-it-happen world.That behind-the-scenes activity is in the likes of Intel (INTC), Nvidia (NVDA), Micron (MU), Samsung (OTC:SSNLF)(OTC:SSNNF), and Western Digital (WDC) - just to name a few.
