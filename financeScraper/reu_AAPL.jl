Apple has said that Shazam, an app that lets users identify songs by pointing a smart phone at the audio source, would be a natural fit with its Apple Music streaming service. Apple had sought approval for the deal from the Austrian competition agency because the bid falls short of the revenue threshold for an EU review. Austria subsequently asked the European Commission to take over the case. France, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Spain and Sweden also put in a similar request. The EU antitrust enforcer said that based on preliminary data provided by the seven countries, the deal may have a significant adverse effect on competition in Europe. Apple will now have to formally ask the Commission to approve the deal. The EU regulator can either clear the bid with or without conditions or open a full-scale investigation if it has serious concerns.", "tick": "AAPL", "headline": "EU regulators to examine Apple buy of UK music discovery app Shazam | Reuters", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}

Apple confirmed in December that software to deal with aging batteries in iPhone 6, iPhone 6s and iPhone SE models could slow down performance. The company apologized and lowered the price of battery replacements for affected models from $79 to $29. In the letter released Tuesday, amid nagging allegations that it slowed down phones with older batteries as a way to push people into buying new phones, the company said it was considering issuing rebates to consumers who paid full price for replacement batteries. The letter, released by the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, also said Apple provided a phone-slowing software update in January 2017 but did not disclose it until a month later. In the letter, Apple said it had known about battery problems caused by a manufacturing defect as early as fall 2016. Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the committee, said in a statement that \u201cconsumers rely on clear and transparent disclosures from manufacturers to understand why their device may experience performance changes.\u201d Thune said that in discussions with the committee \u201cApple has acknowledged that its initial disclosures came up short. Apple has also promised the committee some follow-up information, including an answer about additional steps it may take to address customers who purchased a new battery at full price.\u201d Apple did not immediately comment on Thune\u2019s statement. The company also sent a letter in response to Representative Greg Walden, a Republican who chairs the Committee on Energy and Commerce in the U.S. House of Representatives. Apple told the committee that it would consider extending its reduced-cost battery replacement program beyond 2018 if it can\u2019t find a way to prevent sudden shutdowns in older iPhones without throttling processor speeds. Last week, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission said they were investigating whether Apple violated securities laws concerning its disclosures that it slowed older iPhones with flagging batteries, Bloomberg reported. In a statement last week, Apple said it had \u201creceived questions from some government agencies\u201d and was duly responding to them. The company had \u201cnever, and would never, do anything to intentionally shorten the life of any Apple product, or degrade the user experience to drive customer upgrades,\u201d the statement said. Consumers so far have filed some 50 proposed class action lawsuits over Apple\u2019s latest iPhone software update, which they allege caused unexpected shutdowns and hampered the performance of iPhone models of the SE, 6 and 7 lines. Government agencies in countries ranging from Brazil to France and Italy to South Korea are also investigating Apple following complaints.", "tick": "AAPL", "headline": "Apple sees 'strong demand' for replacement iPhone batteries: letter | Reuters", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}

The tie-up will make Alipay, run by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial, the first third-party mobile payment system to be accepted at any physical Apple store worldwide, Ant Financial said in a statement on Wednesday. Apple\u2019s own payment system has had a lukewarm reception in China. The Cupertino-based firm will accept Alipay payment across its 41 brick-and-mortar retail stores in China, said Ant Financial, which was valued at $60 billion in 2016. Apple, whose China website, iTunes store and App Store have been accepting Alipay for more than a year, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The deal comes as Apple is doubling down on the market and looking to strengthen ties with local Chinese partners and government bodies. The firm\u2019s CEO Tim Cook has made regular recent visits to the country. Apple is also shifting user data to China-based servers later this month to meet local rules and last year removed dozens of local and foreign VPN apps from its Chinese app store. Alipay is China\u2019s top mobile payment platform, but faces stiff competition from rival internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd\u2019s payment system that is embedded within its hugely-popular chat app WeChat. China\u2019s official Xinhua news agency said late on Tuesday that Apple would build its second data center in China in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region after it set up a data center in the southern province of Guizhou last year.", "tick": "AAPL", "headline": "Apple brings Alibaba-linked payment system into China stores amid market push | Reuters", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}

{"link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-lumentum-hldg-apple/lumentums-share-surge-fueled-by-higher-iphone-x-part-sales-idUSKBN1FQ2ZS", "source": "https://www.reuters.com/", "text": "(Reuters) - Shares in Lumentum Holdings Inc soared 23 percent on Tuesday after the optical components maker said it shipped more than $200 million worth of 3D sensing lasers to a customer that two analysts identified as Apple Inc. Lumentum has been seen as the primary supplier of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) that power iPhone X\u2019s intriguing Face ID feature and the TrueDepth camera technology. The $240 million in sales between September and December roughly line up with 60 million phones made, according to MKM Partners analyst Michael Genovese. Lumentum reported a 52.7 percent jump in revenue to $404.6 million and a profit of $1.67 per share in the second quarter ended Dec. 30. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $357.8 million and a profit of $1.12 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \u201cWe attribute the strength to an increased pull of 3D sensing shipments, driven primarily by Apple in December,\u201d wrote Rosenblatt Securities analyst Jun Zhang. But, Lumentum forecast net revenue in the range of $280 million to $305 million and profit of 65 cents to 80 cents for the current quarter, guiding well below analysts\u2019 estimates for revenue of $319.93 million and profit of 86 cents. \u201cLumentum March guide is due to iPhone X unit cuts. LITE did $200 million in 3D sales in December and is guiding to only about $60 million in March. However, after reports from VIAV (Viavi Solutions) and AAPL this is not a surprise,\u201d said Genovese. Apple will halve its iPhone X production target for the first three months of the year to around 20 million units, Nikkei reported late last month. Lumentum said it expected demand to rebound in the second half of its fiscal year. Rosenblatt\u2019s Jun Zhang estimated Apple to procure 120-150 million 3D sensing components for its product ramp in second half of 2018, which comes in line with Lumentum\u2019s expectations. Lumentum\u2019s shares were up 21 percent at $51.70 in afternoon trading. They had touched a high of $52.40.", "tick": "AAPL", "headline": "Lumentum's share surge fueled by higher iPhone X part sales | Reuters", "author": "Reuters Editorial"}
